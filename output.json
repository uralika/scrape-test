It was my first time in the Arts District, so I was very confused about finding my way around, into the building, & even where to order my food. Once I found my way, it was like I was lost my whole life without it. So the seating area & bar entrance is the door on the corner of 3rd & Traction. You order food at the counter which you can enter from Traction Ave or working you're way through the hall behind the seating area.Their selection of sausage meat ranges from traditional to exotic so you can decide how adventurous you want your weiner. I decided to go in deep and try their Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño peppers topped with caramelized onions & sweet peppers, and I was astonished. It was so full of flavor without tasting too gamey. Their selection of mustards were all great with my favorite being the spicy brown. I definitely will be coming back to explore & taste their other meats... Don't read too much into to that..."

There is typically a line, and your order will be placed around 10 minutes after coming into the door. They offer a nice selection of beers that will pair well with your hot dog. Their workers are really knowledgeable about the pairings of beer and hot dogs. They offer a wide range of hot dogs, ranging from veggie dogs to snake dogs. You can definitely step outside your comfort zone when coming here. They offer different kinds of mustards and ketchup on the table that pair well with the dogs. This is a great casual spot to grab food with friends."

My group ordered a couple different options from the original, gourmet, and exotic options. I did not fall head over heals by any of them, but the saving grace is the beer and the ambiance. Cool place to start or end off your night, as the kitchen is open until 1:30 am. Enjoy!"

Next time I'll only get the onions because I feel the peppers took a lot of the flavor off the links. Not too packed if you come around lunch time. There was no line as it usually is after work. In and out within an hour. Highly recommend"

I feel like for some people lamb is an acquired taste but I have acquired it !!!! Lamb definitely tastes different from any other meat (like beef or pork etc) but it has found an amazing home at wurstkuche... Yes to lamb ! Also I love that they have a wide variety of hot dog options including some lesser known/eaten meats. (They even have vegetarian options) There were two hot dogs in one bun (both very thin) but I didn't hate it. I will say that the bun was very tough to chew at times but overall a great eat. My favorite thing about this place is the number of different sauces they have and how they're laid out on all the tables so you have the easiest access. I won't say I didn't make a mess but it was definitely a beautiful and tasty mess."

While waiting in line there is someone to come and grab your drink order, so that definitely makes it easier ha. The fries are delish and definitely go for the bigger order. They are crispy and salty and yum. My favorite out of the two I got was the roasted red pepper (also order the sun dried tomato). Sautéed sweet peppers and onions on it - so yummy!!! Also, I definitely didn't need to order 2 sausages but my eyes are always bigger then my stomach! ENJOY!"

Let's be realistic, you can't really come here and just get a sausage... You have to get the sausage, Belgium fries, and a beer.

I got the Rattlesnake and Rabbit and shared large fries with Curry Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli and it was delicious! The sausage had texture and complex flavor to it unlike any fast food or street dog I've ever tried, and the fries were delicious enough to stand on their own, but were made even better with Curry Ketchup. I can't wait to bring uninitiated friends here.One note: Careful if you order the Lamb with Mediterranean spices. I took a bite out of my friend's (in exchange for a bite of my R&R) and juices burst everywhere."

If you can't seem to find the place it's a corner spot with huge doors near umami and pie hole.I tried the Buffalo, Mango Jalapeno, Duck and Rabbit. Yup, all some exotic types of hot dogs. They have some that are a bit more tame but if you're waiting forever to get into this joint, go big or go home. I enjoyed all the ones I've tried except for the rabbit, though it might just be a taste preference. I found it too gamey for me and only took one or two bites of it. All the rest were on point. You have a choice of putting sweet pepper, which I definitely recommend. The fries are thick cut and comes with sauces for dipping. My favorite of the ones I've tried is the chipotle aioli and pesto mayo. I have yet to get the beer here but I will in the near future.  If you just want to try this place out, the line during lunch is way shorter than the dinner line. But there's definitely a better overall atmosphere if you come during dinner time."

        "review": "The place was OK.  I think most of the hype comes from it's location and cool atmosphere.  The wursts themselves were just ok (we tried the brat, snake and duck/bacon).  Also, the price of the wieners were pretty good, considering it's a \"hip\" joint .  And boo on the price of fries - it's nice that you get two dipping sauces, but the fries were not super special. Brat breakdown:Original Brat: it was slightly dry, but the best of the 3 we tried.  Nothing special as far as the seasoning, as far as I could tell, but not a bad brat. And the buns were pretty decent.Duck with Bacon:  maybe we got a wiener that was unlucky in the bacon department, but there was hardly a hint of bacon (not sure I even tasted it).  Otherwise, it was lackluster, but not bad tasting.Snake: again, nothing special, except it's interesting to say you've had snake - now mark that off your bucket list.  The flavor was not bad - in fact, it did have an interesting spice to it, but you could have told me it was pork, or cat, or zebra, and I wouldn't have known it was an alternative meat.  But if I were caught stranded in the desert, I would now have no problem eating rattler, if I had to...All in all, a fun place to try, but not a place I would haunt."

You order then find seating in the back. It's pretty spacious back there, but picnic table seating for the most part. They bring your food to you. Food. Duck sausage with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, a small side of fries and a beer for about $20 give or take. To be honest, everything was extremely salty. The salt overpowered every other taste that was in that meal. That's all I really remember. Maybe I should try another sausage if I ever find myself in the area. But yeah, nothing special."

Add some Chipotle ketchup & you have yourself a great meal. Chicken Apple & Spices with caramelize onions & sweet peppers: I decided to try the chicken apple & spices sausage... it comes with apples & specks of cinnamon.

I don't usually eat red meat, so I've tried many of the chicken and vegetarian varieties. It's an awesome little hot dog joint with everything from classic sausages to exotic rabbit, crocodile and even rattlesnake! I haven't been brave enough to try these, but I've heard rave reviews. There is a long, extensive beer list that offers something for every palette. The dining area is reminiscent of an Oktoberfest Beer Hall. It's sort of a communal dining experience in that you'll seat yourself at a large picnic style table with other diners. It's a really fun place to come with a big group or for a celebration, just try to get there early to reserve a table because it gets packed. At night, there's usually a DJ present to liven things up. It's honestly a fun spot to just spend an evening out with friends. Highly recommended for good casual dining!"

It was also perfect for late night cravings which was when I went to check this place out. This place is unlike any other hot dog place in that they serve some of the most exotic sausages around. They have crazy combinations unavailable anywhere else. With so many choices, I went with a snake and rabbit sausage. I wanted to try something different and that was by far the most interesting choice. What other place serves something like this?The only thing I would say is that I like to eat hot dogs with lots of toppings and condiments and stuff and this place didn't have much of those. Regardless, it was a very interesting combination of flavors and I was impressed. If you are looking for something different from your average hot dogs, check this place out."

I only like freshly baked bread from actual restaurants. This one just feels diluted in some way, airy, foamed up. The sausages were just like whatever too. Maybe the ratios were off. You ask for 2 toppings and they throw them on there for you. The sausages are not big. An LA street hotdog is like 5 times better than any of the hotdogs I tried here. If you get a street hotdog you get the bacon, mayo, grilled onions, a grilled jalapeno and regular bread (It's not freshly baked but it doesn't feel like a damn sponge). A street hotdog is like 5 bucks on a busy night, this place sells the hotdogs for 7 bucks and up.  I wouldn't recommend this place unless you want to eat a hotdog and drink a beer at the same time. Also, when I went, they had a DJ. They have outside seating.  Another thing, their fries. They sucked. I'm not big on salt but these fries tasted like they had none. You get a dipping of choice with your fries. I picked chipotle ketchup but I couldn't taste any of the chipotle.  I had high expectations of this place because the times I've passed through there they always have a long line. Why do people like this place? I don't know. Maybe they've never had a LA street hot dog. Even a costco hotdog is better than one from here, at least price wise.  Attire: Wear a stupid bowtie and suspenders."

Finally after months of searching I have found my SoCal Top Dog. I ordered the hot link and it was exactly how a hot link should be... HOT! I've been to Pink's and tried their hot link and to my surprise it was not good, decent at best. This place is the real dog. They have every type of hot dog. If you're in the area and want a great, delicious hot dog is say come to this place. The only downside, but I'm ok with it, is the price. TopDog prices their dogs at $3 and I usually get two. Here one dog with toppings adds to about $8-$10 dollars which isn't bad! Definitely one of the best places I have been to in LA! The vibe is super laid back and don't forget to order beer. They have some killer selection. Also, a rare thing to see was three solid options for vegetarians. My two vegetarian friends feasted on their dogs and said they were the best they had ever had.

I didnt like the rattlesnake and rabbit - the meat was too strong in flavor for me and too salty for my taste. The duck with bacon and rabbit with veal was also just OK...

Vegetarian options are available however that's never gonna happen for me!  An assortment of mustards are on each table.Food was outstanding - two toppings are included, I went with the sweet peppers and the hot peppers. (other choices are caramelized onions and sauerkraut) I was lucky to enjoy this place with some fellow Yelpers, we ordered a few different sausages each - then cut them up and shared - a great way to try several items! I checked their prices against my local place for brats (Mattern Meats) - prices are comparable for the Classic wursts - prices climb for the Gourmet and Exotics portion of the menu - but that's to be expected, and was not a problem for me! Enjoyed everything I tried: Classic Bratwurst was very good; Austin Blues -hot and spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork from the Gourmet Menu; and from the Exotics menu - Duck & Bacon With Jalapeño Peppers; Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Wine; and Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeño Peppers. The last one had me wondering - could you feed jalapeños to a  rabbit, feed the rabbit to a rattlesnake then kill it to make the sausage? These are they types of thoughts you have when hanging out with Roy B.Shared some fries - the dipping sauces are the star of the show - especially the Bleu Cheese Walnut And Bacon - a table favorite.Best value in the place - a pint of PBR for $3 - That was my choice - and I was high fived by several at the bar for making it! I think Roy was a little bummed when he got his wine glass size, half foam 8 dollar whatever it was.Community tables and benches make for a friendly place, I would have liked the option to get a pitcher of beer - but I hear the place gets very crowded later in the evening and it seems like a good place to hang out - so pitchers not be a good idea.Would be a regular if they opened one of these in North OC!!"

I was actually contemplating between the duck and rabbit or rattlesnake and rabbit sausage before decided on duck. I was too chicken to eat rattlesnake. Too chicken to eat the whole thing but I still wanted to try it so I took a bite out of my friend's rattlesnake and rabbit sausage. LOL it was firm. There was a crunch when you bite into the sausage. Now I can say I ate snakes once. They offer a good variety of beer and sodas. If you don't find anything you want to drink then you my friend, are high maintenance. The crowds was a mix.

From the street, this place is unassuming, you'd have no idea what it was. Inside, it's a pretty cool atmosphere. I went at lunch when it wasn't very busy but based on what I've heard, it gets pretty busy at dinner time and seating probably not so abundant.As for the food itself... if I was juding just based on food, I'd give it three stars. The sausage was ok, I had the buffalo beef and pork... it tasted pretty dry but flavorful. The fries were good but at least half of them seemed to be overdone.  Other than that, cool little joint! :)"

Their staff is really friendly and I love hanging out in the Arts District. However, the food taste-wise, is only okay. Their sausages are quite salty and the meat to bun ratio is ridiculous - too much bread! My favorite thing to get here is their fries!!! Their fries are really tasty and I love their dipping sauce options. Catching up with friends here always sound better in theory than on execution. The noise level is REALLY LOUD and seating can be hard to find during peak hours. Seats aren't the most comfortable and there's occasionally hovering when others are table stalking - making it not the best place to hang out for a long time. I also think they would benefit by having another cashier. The wait to order can be up to 20 min during peak hours and the line spills onto the outside (their ordering area is way too small). Perhaps they can adopt a hybrid \"In-N-Out\" drive-through line style of ordering so the cashier only has to handle payments to speed up the process? Plus your food will arrive faster! In short: for a better time, come on weekdays but come for atmosphere, not the food (except the fries!). Parking: pretty challenging. If you get lucky/show up early enough, there's meter parking (free after a certain time). If not, there are paid lots to tide you over. Better yet: Metro in (gold line)"

I am delighted it hasn't changed in service and quality. I was glad I didn't have to wait in a 30+ minute line like the first time I came here as it was 11pm and not too many folks were around. I ordered the Lamb with Mediterranean Spices with spicy peppers and caramelized onions as well as a delicious beer. The sausage was delicious. It reminded me of lamb and harissa. Definitely very Mediterranean-Moroccan vibe going on there. My friend had the buffalo and pork. Not as delicious as mine but definitely had a nice smokiness going for it.There is a nice selection of mustards on the side and took advantage of them. We shared a large order of fries and they were dipped in copious amounts of mustards as well as the pesto mayo and curry ketchup (both delicious by the way).I'll be back once I go through all the other bookmarks I have on Yelp."

As a matter of fact, my three beers came in different glasswares, so I give them credit for presentation there.Wanted to get food a couple times here, but the line is just insane!! The atmosphere is a bit too dark for my liking, and the bar is rather plain when it comes to decoration.

You order at the front, then head down a little corridor to the back section where the seating is. Seating consists of a lot of long, communal benches as well as some side tables. The overall feel is dive-y, casual, and perfect for groups. When ordering, you get the option of 2 out of 4 toppings for your brat: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers (bell peppers), and spicy peppers.SAUSAGES:My favorite of the ones I've tried so far is the Buffalo, Beef, and Pork w/Chipotle Peppers. It has a medium-heat, smokey spiciness and bold flavor. The Duck and Bacon w/Jalapeno Peppers is a close second, with a slightly more fatty taste. I've tried the Rattlesnake and Rabbit w/Jalapeno before and it just didn't stand out to me. That said, I think you're perfectly fine going with Classics ($6) or Gourmets ($7) rather than the pricier Exotics. They do well in spicing their sausages, and thus the spices stand out more than the actual meat. I have a couple vegetarian friends who rave about their vegetarian sausage options. My only complaint is that the sausages are pretty small for what you pay. Without a side order of fries or a beer, you definitely won't be full.BELGIAN FRIES + DIPPING SAUCES:I really think that Wurstkuche shines in their Belgian fries and dipping sauces, not so much their sausages. The small size includes one dipping sauce and is $3.50 and the large includes 2 dipping sauces and is $5.50. The large is good for sharing between 2-3 people, though they're so good you could probably devour an entire order yourself. The fries are thick-cut, always crispy on the outside, and perfect with the truffle glaze (though $2 extra for this is a bit pricey). Get the chipotle aioli dipping sauce! It's creamy and smokey and I can't get enough of it. Curry ketchup is another good option.I love Wurstkuche for its laid-back vibe and simple, tasty menu options. Go for the sausages, stay for the fries!"

The parking is outrageous, almost makes you not want to go- $10 or $7 flat rate (don't let the $2 and $3 lots full you - it means for every 10 mins not flat rate). Not worth it for a sausage hot dog- that's almost as much as one of their sausages. Try to find street parking if you're lucky enough because there are alot of businesses in that area. Heard the fries were pretty good, we tried chipotle aioli and bleu cheese bacon and walnut. The blue cheese, you can literally taste all those flavors and chipotle was good too but how you would imagine it to taste. Both were super creamy (not a huge fan of cream) so the fries tasted good with their ketchup as well. Ketchup is a little sweeter than heinz.We tried rattle snack and rabbit-very good and packed with flavor, tasted more gritty and earthy. Pleathen (spelling)- SUPER HERBY. Really good though, but after awhile tasted like dim sum dumplings. It is pretty pricy for the amount of food given but you will really have to appreciate the quality of the meat and the uniqueness!

Honestly this place seems a bit overpriced for what they're serving you, but I suppose you're paying for the 'exotic-ness.'  Also, there seemed to be plenty of seating, but be ready to wait in line for a bit especially if you come during peak hours. Lastly, and I've mentioned this before, traffic and parking in downtown LA sucks. It might not be worth it to make the drive all the way to downtown just for this, but if you're in the area then this place is worth a try at least once. You might as well also try the other nearby restaurants and enjoy the art district/little Tokyo while you're at it to make the drive and search for parking worth it."

There are both exotic hot dogs (rattlesnake duck, rabbit, etc.) and regular hot dogs that are stellar. I am not an average hot dog eater, but I make an exception for Wurst. My advice is try an exotic just to say you did and then find your favorite amongst the regulars. My favorite is the mango jalapeño! Belgian fries are also delicious - get it with the pesto mayo and you won't be disappointed! Dining area is always bustling and usually has a DJ playing jams. Really cool place to get together for an easy bite with friends."

Finding a seat can be a challenge for large groups, but if it's only two of you then you should be fine. The meat choices may be a little exotic but delecious. The rattlesnake and rabid was delicious. We all tried different things and nobody was disappointed."

SO tasty and gave me the perfect buzz)-long lines at all times, even when I went at midnight this weekend (a worker comes around asking if you want a beer while you wait in line though.. makes waiting a little better)-you order and grab a number and they bring you out your food after about 15 mins or so-cute brown menu that's concise and to the point -seating in the back, both indoors and outdoors-- cafeteria style -delicious steak fries with truffle oil (ask for it well done and try a few of the sauces they offer)-about five or so mustards available (my faves being Dijon and whole grain) -choose one or two exotic hot dogs (my faves are mango jalapeño, Austin blues, and the rattlesnake!) and add two toppings! -service is whatever's. The girls taking the order and grabbing us beers while we were in line were total bitches. I wouldn't say that shit if it wasn't true. I'm sure they don't give a flying shit if service is good or not since it is a order and take a number kinda place.-open late so it's a prime spot for a late night drink and snack (live DJ at night keeps the place poppin with good music)-located in the Arts District so there's always something and someone to see around there"

Rattlesnake & rabbit sausage didn't taste any different from regular sausages. But, I really loved the duck and bacon sausage. I def recommend people also try some of their belgium beer. I love their beer list. I could spend all night here just trying all of them. Their restaurant is more of a cafeteria. Order up front and go find seats in a public seating area with long picnic tables. They'l bring your food to you. Which is pretty cool cuase you can mingle with other people or have plenty of seating if you come here with a group of friends. The only thing I hate about this place is parking. But, its the art district. I usually park near urth cafe and just walk over."

Complimentary sauces (Whole Grain, Dijon, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, American Yellow, Ketchup) are available on the counter. Water and cups are on the counter as well. The water tasted like cucumbers, wonderful touch. They offer a nice selection of nonalcoholic and alcoholic drinks. Very impressive. Employees were quick. Ordered a Crocodile & Pork Smoked Andouille Sausage. You have a choice of 2 toppings: Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut Sweet Peppers, or Spicy Peppers. It had a nice smokey flavor but was a bit on the chewier side. A great place for sausages and beer (or if you're like me, some Strawberry soda)."

        "review": "Okay so the place's setup is a bit odd but neat.  You can enter from the main entrance where you got basically a deli with nearly no seating, a girl will hand you a menu and is pretty cool about asking everybody in line whether or not they have any questions, or want a beer ahead of time, as you stand in line figuring out what to order.  That's way cool.  She was friendly, staff was generally just neat and friendly.Their menu is divided by regular sausages and exotic ones.  Whatever sausage you get comes in a bun.  You also get to choose 2 of 4 toppings (sauerkraut, carmelized onion, spicy pepper & sweet pepper).The nice girl at the door suggested the rabbit/rattlesnake sausage with carmelized onion and spicy pepper.  I went with that.  It was so-so (hate to say).On that point, one time I had a guy working the bar at a restaurant tell me when they had a wild game night (with like kangaroo meat and crap) that if \"random exotic animal\" tasted so good you'd see it on the menu everywhere.  So... rattlesnake... yeah its not bad, just didn't spark.  I can say I ate rattlesnake though.  I had rabbit back in New Orleans so that wasn't new, but rattlesnake...Also I had a small order of the fries, which come with dipping sauces if you want them.  They were steak fries.  I don't like steak fries, but I know others do so whatever that's just a preference.  The chipotle ketchup was pretty good.  I liked that sauce.Also the guy at the register/cashier was pretty cool and real helpful too in trying to suggest a drink.  They have a bunch of odd bottled sodas and other drinks and he alerted me to this particular lemonade's carbonation... which was helpful because I don't like carbonation.  It does seem like they want you to make a good selection.  He was cheery.  I dig their staff.Also the tables in the back have like 5-6 different mustards to try on them, so that's kinda neat.  Dijon, spicey, honey, traditional, and some other stuff.Its hipster-like, so look out if you get offended by douchey beards, \"unique\" vintage clothing and a bunch of hoops in noses and bad hairdos.  This is the place with the type of look you would expect from a bunch of transplants that picked dumpy downtown LA to live in thinking it'd be a good idea wanting to get into fashion or acting and being eccentric.  I suppose if I was a girl and getting hit on by a guy that wants to read me poetry or ask if I've been to the latest art walk over and over again that'd annoy the crap outta me, but I'm a guy, and I don't need to fend off hipster advances, so that doesn't bug me.  Its like being at a place with an aquarium with weird fish, so the hipster vibe I suppose is a plus cause people watching.  It is better than ghetto.  That said, it is in an area that feels ghetto but isn't, there's a bunch of young adults so I'm guessing there's a college nearby.So just to re-cap (out of 10):- Food - 7 - They got exotic things so if you wanna say I ate rattlesnake go get one try it and never order it again (I thought it was meh), so far I haven't found my muse at this place food-wise and maybe I will and can bump it up a bit more.- Staff Personality/Service - 9 - People were pretty nice I liked them.  That girl at the door was super nice, as was the cashier/guy.  I ultimately did not like the suggestion from the girl at the door but at least I tried rattlesnake so maybe that wasn't a bad call.- Hipster Vibe - Null - Who cares? (as a guy)  I suppose it adds a little bit of uniqueness and something to see.- Price - 7 - Kinda pricey but I did just try rattlesnake sooo I guess its not that bad.  I shouldn't expect to pay pork prices for rattlesnake (even if its functionally not much different).- Booze - Didn't try, so no mark.So hope this is helpful.  I'll try it again when I come back in the area, and maybe have a drink or something and may update this."

        "review": "Wurstkuche has good food and a unique atmosphere, but I don't think it warrants being the second-to-most reviewed restaurant in Los Angeles. WARNING: If you don't eat pork, your menu options will be very limited. Every sausage here, except for the chicken apple sausage and the vegetarian sausages, contains pork. Wurstkuche is located in the small, but interesting downtown arts district, replete with hipsters and good walking (just make sure not to stray into the dangerous abutting areas). There was a line when we went, and that seems to be pretty common. The line goes quickly - in our case, we ordered at the counter after about 15-20 minutes, and then went and found a seat.Atmosphere: This is where this establishment stands out. What makes it unique is the long, picnic-like tables where you sit, next to perfect strangers. The idea, I think, is to get random people talking to each other, but in reality people tend to stick to their own cliques. If you want privacy, you can sit in the surrounding booths like we did (the long picnic-tables were all full). There is a DJ spinning good music, and it's dark inside. The place is filled to the brim with hipsters.Food: A large beer selection, including a cider. The hot dogs are unique and delicious. I had the chicken apple sausage and my lady had a vegetarian sausage, and both were pretty good. The fries were great too! Fun times all-in-all!"

The White Truffle Oil infused fries were to die for and perish the thought that I should ever come here again without ordering these. To notch it up, I got two containers of Pesto and Mayo dipping sauce, shoved some fries in the sandwich and slathered this dipping sauce on it. Yeah...mouth's watering just thinking about it. Additionally, the staff was quite friendly for such a busy place, so special mention just had to be made of it."

All of them are delicious, but if you want spicy, get the rattlesnake or the rabbit and pork. Can't go wrong with the toppings.Beer selection is quite nice. I always get the Franziskaner weissbier (5%, $6), or the Bitburger pilsner (4.5%, $6). Both very tasty.If you're gonna go all out, get the large fries (Groot), and with the truffle oil glaze.

Not the Silverlake kind but rather the Wurstküche  kind.I love sausages!  Ok there I said it!  And I love this place with the name no one can pronounce! yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…Sausages, I love them all big, small, white, red, brown, spicy, BBQ, plain, Italian, Dodger, Chinese, German, Polish,  Portuguese, Mexican, Filipino, smoked, grilled, breakfast, skinless, venison, chicken, beef, turkey, pork, blood, mystery meat, cheese filled, summer, patties, wurst, knock, bock, natural case, hot links, salami, boerewors, chorizo, bangers, andouille,  bologna, linguica, or any of the hundreds of other variations. In fact I've never met one I didn't like!At 11pm as we pulled up the place was pumpin' out sausages and beats to a full house with a line out the door. I was pleasantly surprised by the quickness the line moved. One minute I'm out side the next I'm in front of the sausage counter yelp.com/user_local_phot… then I'm gettin' flipped off by one of the cooks  yelp.com/user_local_phot… LOL really I chopped off his peace sign. And in a couple more minutes I had ordered and was holding a nice cold Spaaten yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs… and heading to the dining room in the back. I was immediately struck by the hipster crowd packed in to the room having a great time. This ain't your parents Wiener-schnitzel this is a sausage eatin' beer drinkin party folks. DJ spinning and the DTLA youth scene in full effect!  yelp.com/user_local_phot…  yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs… I really dig this place except for the horrible music the DJ was spinning! Techno scrambled with the carpenters. Really?? WTF? BARF!FOOD: We each ordered a couple different wienies and shared. Sorry for the crummy pics.Bock-worst: who doesn't love a nice Veal & Pork white sausage with some kraut and spicy mustard. 4.5****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Hot Italian: My fav! I'm always a fan of Italian sausages, toss on some peppers and onions and I got your back all night long. This was a damn good Sausage! 5*****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Duck, Bacon & Jalapeno: Exotic for sure but not the spiciest (mild) of the bunch, still the peppers added to the nice pop this one had. 4****Starsyelp.com/user_local_phot…Crocodile & Pork Andouille:  This exotic surprised me with its taste. The sausage was very nicely spiced and sure to be a favorite of all that try it. Nice pop on this one as well.  I'm a big Crocodile fan so I really liked this one. 4.5****StarsSun Dried Tomato and Mozzarella: Smoked chicken and turkey was not my fav but still like all the others it was a solid dawg. 3.5***StarsDan also ordered some fries and I think I ate most of them and I loved 'em with the Blue cheese walnut bacon dip. OMG that stuff should be illegal! It was so effin good! The fries looked dark and burnt. Nope double cooked to perfection and were some of the best fries I've had in a long time! 5*****StarsAll I want to know is when they gonna open a Wurstküche in my hood? The packing house has plenty of room! Just say'n.  Hey you Wurstküche dudes paying attention?What's  Wurstküche? Its when you reach down between your dates legs and find a sausage. That's the worst coochie. LOLI'll be back for sure! They made a fan out of me!"

The guy who took our order was nothing but patient and friendly (not sure how much this differs when they are busy).  This place is self-serve and self-seating. It looks like a large warehouse that got converted into a hipster restaurant. Love the ambiance and décor of this place--such a fan of the rustic look. The food was okay, got the chicken which seemed the most normal to me but still didn't blow it out of the water for me.By the time we left, the line was literally outside, circling the building, so coming at a good time is probably a good idea.

Aside from the fact that this is one of the most unique restuarants in LA, the flavors of the sausages are amazing. So flavorful and savory, and with a variety of spices not usually present in say, beef hot dogs.First timer, went with a group of friends and ordered the most exotic sausages on the menu, with the exeception of a few classics. We went with the rattlesnake, the pheasant, the rabbit, the chicken and apple with spices, and the mango jalepeno, what a mouthful. The pheasant was pleasantly savory, and went well with some onions, kraut, and honey mustard! The rabbit was a bit gamey for my taste, but objectively speaking, still good with the onions. Well the onions were good on everything.The fries were a nice addition to the meal, and I especially enjoyed the variety of sauces to dip them in! Naturally the pesto mayo was delicious, and so was the chipotle ketchup. All in all, great good, nice ambience, and a good variety of drinks as well, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic (mandarin orange jigger was odd at first, but a swig or two after a bite of sausage was really refreshing.)"

They have quite the extensive selection of sausages and beer aplenty. There's also vegetarian options, which makes this a great lunch spot for everyone. I had the mango jalapeño and my bf had the chicken apple and spices - both delicious. I liked how it was sweet with a little kick of spice. You can also choose caramelized onions, spicy peppers, or sauerkraut as toppings. If you're feeling adventurous, you can try some of the more exotic meats such as pheasant, rattlesnake, rabbit, etc. We also shared a side of the Belgian fries with Tzatziki (Greek yogurt) sauce and chipotle aioli sauce. Overall great food! I wasn't much of a fan of sausages before, but Wurstkuche has convinced me otherwise!"

Their dogs are certainly not simple ordinary hotdogs. There's exotic flavours and new meats that will raise some brows, but they delicious! They have a large variety of different kinds of dogs, that you can mix and match with the toppings. These with the fries and maybe a cold beer will make your night better.    Last time I came, I wanted to be a bit adventurous and try the rabbit and rattlesnake. It was surprisingly pretty tasty. You can surely tell a bit of a difference with meat, and the aftertaste, but I thoroughly enjoyed my brat. It's meaty and juicy. I got it with fries and an aioli dipping cause. There is also different kinds of mustard on your tables for your convenience. The initial entrance makes it look a bit small, as it is just a store front where you order your meal. Then you go through the long and narrow hallway to the dining area of the restaurant, which is pretty big.The staff is usually friendly, the only struggle is the parking in DTLA. Once you find parking, you wont have to worry about anything else. Plus there is a Pie Hole right next door, for a sweet treat after your savory meal."

In fact, as I am writing this, I'm upgrading them from 3 to 4 stars for the service...and the vanilla cream soda, which was super tasty! The fries, which we shared, were EXCELLENT. I went with kielbasa for my sausage, with grilled onions. Both my friends went with the vegetarian smoked apple sage. We all felt like, for a place where the sausages are the star, these sausages were good but not amazing. I'd go for a fritzi dog over a wurstkuche dog any day, for example. But, they have a ton of beer on tap and a great atmosphere and we thought it would be fun to go back and just chill on a weekend afternoon with \"beers and brats\" so to speak. Also, it's right across the street from Pie Hole, which is convenient ;) But, seriously, the Arts District is definitely an up and coming area of downtown, and Wurstkuche fits right in."

Its in the arts district with a lot of pretentious people walking around.  walked in and great customer service... ordered a Kielbasa dog and ask what IPA's and/or reds they had. Was told the selection was limited since they specialize in Belgians, wheats and pale ales.  I selected a beer with the most hops and sat at the bench. atmosphere was cool, but what I didn't like was the ability for people to bring in their small children in.  There were 3 parties, one with a 10 yr old and 2 with infants.  Just my luck, one of the infants started to cry and the parents ignored it while they drank beer.  Something really awful about getting your drink on while your infant child is screaming.  This place should not allow small children in. It's inappropriate to say the least.So, as I sat there drinking my beer and trying to tune out the crying baby, I had flashbacks of being in a Kindercare, but this time with a cold beer. I finished and walked to the long bar they had to order another beer since the child had calmed down.  I asked the waitress for recommendation. Settled on a beer with the name \"Hopp\" in it. forget what it was but it was tasty. I would go back just for that one beer.Finished and left... Pros.. good sausagesprice per dog is good ($6.50)long sit down tables were cool,fresh air with an open nearby doorCons:they allow children in the bar areacost of beer was a little high ($9.00)I would come back but only if I was in area"

I am  skeptical in general of all forms of mechanically separated meats. To paraphrase a quote from a famous black man, \"rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I wouldn't eat the motherf*cker.\"I stuck with the Kielbasa. It rocked. The fresh chewy bun, spicy meat, and crisp snap of the sausage casing was all money.  A-The bratwurst wasn't bad either. I would give it a B. The wedge fries were excellent. I typically don't like wedge fries as I find them too dry. But these were like mash potatoes on the inside and hyper crispy on the outside. AI was initially annoyed by the long line to order the food prior to sitting. But after some thought, I realized it cut down on the waiting time. There are  no unnecessary bottlenecks to idly wait for a table to open up. Its brilliant. Another plus is the huge octoberfest style dining room with the shared tables.  I am tempted to slam the mugs together and yell \"Prost!!\" Great place for sausage and beer."

The line can get quite long, but it moves relatively fast.They have a large selection of beers (and also international drinks!) and various sausages and fries. I ended up going with the rattlesnake, feeling adventurous. It was really good but a lot more subtle in flavors than I expected. I definitely need to come back and try more of their sausages. More importantly, however, is their Belgian fries. After studying in Brussels, all I dreamed about every single day was eating Belgian fries and I have to say Wurstkuche does it perfectly. Not only do they make amazing fries but also have a bunch of dipping sauces (though they should add andalouse and brazil to make it even more Belgian!)The fries were definitely the most satisfying part of the meal. The long tables in the dinning area was really nice and definitely created a fun, inclusive, casual atmosphere. They were also playing like low-key turn up music which was cool.

This restaurant is located around the back of little Tokyo where umami, pie hole, etc, is. P A R K I N G:Parking is a hit or miss--sometimes it's really easy to find parking but I've also had to pay for $2 valet about a block away which isn't bad at all. I usually come around 6-7pm and never had to wait more than 10 minutes to order. However, I've walked by around 9-10pm (going to pie hole for dessert hehe), and the line extends beyond the door! F O O D:What's really special about this place are the sausages. They have many exotic flavors such as rabbit and rattle snake--makes me feel super adventurous when eating it, haha! But honestly, if you're afraid, it's sounds crazier than it actually is. You can definitely taste the differences between each type of sausage but overall every sausage is super duper delicious--my personal favorite is the rabbit. You have a choice of adding toppings such as onions and sour kraut onto your hot dog but honestly I am not a big fan of that stuff so I always just eat it as is. They have ketchup and several types of mustard on each table so have fun mixing and matching. Even though the hot dog fills you up pretty well I always order a side of small fries (usually to share with a friend) because their fries (MUST get the one with truffle oil) are DELICIOUS! It's perfectly crispy and thick--it's divine. You get to choose a dipping sauce and they have a very wide selectionm making it very hard to decide on one because I want to try multiple--my personal favorite is the chipotle aoli. They have a bar area at the back of the store which I have yet to try. They also sell a variety of European soft drinks--it's pretty much coke but in a glass bottle, triple the price, and taste a bit different. It's worth a try, but I personally wouldn't order it again cause I'm totally good with water. This place is great to hangout with friends and also for a casual date. I will definitely be coming back to this place again and again!"

They have a nice selection of gourmet sodas.I tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers, $8. It was mild tasting as advertised. Perhaps a tad too mild because I could not discern the taste. The sausage had a good snap when I bit into it and I enjoyed the smoky essence.Once the novelty of trying the exotic meats (up until that point, it was the first time I ate either rattlesnake or rabbit in any form) wore off, I quickly determined that it is best to stick with the classic bratwursts and hot links. Nothing, in my opinion, can match the juiciness, smokiness and succulent flavors of pork and beef.There will be a return visit at some point and I trust a higher evaluation will ensue after I try what Wurstkuche is primarily known for: the classic bratwurst and any number of imported beers on tap."

It seems like they always have at least three vegetarian sausage options, and I've never been disappointed by any of them!I've had the Vegetarian Italian, Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage, and the Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle and they are all great! My personal favorite is the apple sage because it's a little bit sweet a little bit savory, and it handles toppings really well. With any of the sausages that you order you get to pick two toppings (carmelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers) and unlimited mustards - the whole grain is awesome.And you guys, THE FRIES. Oh Lord I could write a whole novel on how delicious the fries here are. Crispy, piping hot, not dripping in grease...AND they have like a million different dipping sauces. I DIE. Just writing this post is making me crave the fries. And let's not forget the beer - awesome draft selection, especially of German and Belgian beers. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super knowledgeable about beer, but the bartenders here are really friendly and will help you out if you have an idea of what you're looking for. As far as non-alcoholic beverages (pssh, really?) they DO have free cucumber water, which is super refreshing and delicious. The ambiance of this place is cool and fun, and there's always plenty of seating a their long \"mess-hall\" style tables and benches - I love that it's not stuffy at all. Parking can be a bit tricky since it's in the arts district, but if you drive around enough you're bound to find street parking sooner or later.

The bar serves only beer and wine but one can't go wrong with a sausage and a beer (Spaten Optimator for me, thank you!). There are no sweets and the sodas are just as eclectic as the range of flavors of sausages - Fentiman's Dandelion and Burdock.

But they were awesome to have while waiting in line, plus I loved the glasses.I got the Rattlesnake and Rabbit brat and he got the Santa Fe Jack Cheese and Jalapeno brat.  Both were delicious!  While we were waiting in line they also gave us samples of the Mango Jalapeno which I am definitely going to get next time because it tasted so good.  What can I say about the fries that hasn't already been said?  They are THE BEST fries I have ever had and the dipping sauces are next level.  I think I need to make that pesto mayo at home because we were both obsessed with it.  Anyways, we wanted to feel really authentic so we ordered two of the giant mugs (steins?) for $12 each and they were a full liter of beer.  I don't think I have ever drank so much beer in my life (not much of a beer drinker, but the beers here were so damn good).  The ambiance of going from the little waiting/ordering area and then down the long dark hallway into the sweet open dining/bar area was really cool.  Loved the atmosphere, can't wait to come back with a big group of friends!"

        "review": "If you're coming to Wurstküche you pretty much know what you're getting into. Personally, I come for the great beer selection and their fries with truffle oil. Thank you baby Jesus in a manger for their truffle fries! You don't even need dipping sauces when your order their fries with truffle oil.I'm a vegetarian, so I'm limited to three options on their sausage menu, which is fine, I'm never disappointed. Hey, three options is a lot better than most places! My favorite is the Mexican chipotle,which actually isn't spicy at all (at least not to me). Also, all my meat eating friends who go with me have nothing but good things to say about their sausage selections. I really think the big selling point for Wurstküche is their ambiance. Because can you get great tasting food, cooked the right way, and a large German/ European beer selection at other locations? Yes. Of course, especially in LA. But as an Army brat, who was born in Munich, Germany, this place feeds my nostalgia as well as my stomach. Their open dining room with large bench seating reminds me of the annual Oktoberfest and it's always fun eating here, whether it be a quick bite before a Dodger game or an extended stay with lots of friends and lots of rounds of Spaten and Bitburger. Definitely give this place a try. Yes, its' a bit of a hipster joint, yes, it's a little overpriced, yes, it's trendy. But it's fun. The food is decent, the beer is on point and you get to share a good experience with whoever you decided to take with you."

Love how it kind of has an amusement park feel where you wait a line, get into a small ordering area, and once you've successfully placed your order, you walk into the dining area and outdoor patio filled with other happy hot dog eaters. Everyone seems to forget about the line they just waited in. It's one of those places that everyone just needs to try once, and figure out if they want to be a regular or a one timer. The exotic meat is definitely eye catching, and where else will you try rattlesnake, rabbit, or veal. The truffle fries could use a bit more truffle, so ask for extra. I'm also into more thinner fries. Sauces! Love how you have so much to try out to figure out the perfect combo.suggestionsDont be afraid to try the rattlesnake & rabbit. If I can do it, you can! Duck and Bacon isnt bad either. Pick the sausage, and add jalapeno peppers, caramelized onions and sauerkraut."

        "review": "I think for any non-German speaker, we end up pronouncing the name of this place as \"Worst Coochie\". According to one of the co-owner, Tyler Wilson,  Wurstküche is pronounced very similar to \"Voos-kee-ka\" meaning sausage kitchen. You will probably get a different pronunciation if you ask the Internet. Most likely, a fluent German speaking person will tell you that the word doesn't exist. So who knows.All I have to say is this place is expensive if you want to get drunk. If you're just looking to eat a hot dog and small fries with a beer, you will survive having to spend about $20. Good thing is that portions are fulfilling. People tend to be satisfied with the length and girth of the würst, and most people aren't greedy and become satisfy with just one. Sometimes some people feel brave and claim \"l've done this before, I know I can handle more than two würste\". Anyways, the  small order of fries are the equivalent of approximately one large potato. When it comes to the parking situation I have some good news, and unfortunately some bad new. The good news is that down Traction Avenue there's plenty of free parking spots with a 4 hour limit. The bad news is that you have be lucky or simply patient to get a spot. Your other option is to pay a few dollars at the parking lot, or there's some meters down 3rd street. Then, you may get traumatized when you see a 20 person line forming outside of the building, but it's not as bad as it seems. When you walk into the place, you immediately encounter the cooler with all the sausages, the kitchen, the beer spouts, and the cash register. The hallway to the right will lead you to the restrooms on your left side, and down the hall you have the dining room and the bar. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that if there's 20 people outside, then there's about 5 more people inside waiting in line; therefore, there's a fast moving line composed of 25 people. You will not have to confront a 25 person line, and most likely be lucky finding a parking spot if you know the correct time to visit. During the weekdays avoid the lunch rush hour between 11:30 to 2, and avoid the weekends. Wurstküche is located in the Arts District, so that means this area is Mecca for hipsters. If you're like Anthony Bourdain where hipster make him feel a type way, then all I have to say is to not panic. The only thing that you'll see are hipsters, non hipsters, old , and young drinking fancy beers (except the children) and taking bites off their würste ."

I was feeling adventurous so i chose the rattlesnake jalepeno and the pork filipino sausages.  The rattlesnake was good, but felt that the jalepeno overpowered the meat.  Rattlesnake is a lean meat so naturally it was not as juicy as other sausages, but by no means dry.  The filipino was juicy and had a good balance of spices.  The toppings were good (i tried all 4).  The spicy peppers were not too spicy, so it did not hide the flavor of the sausage.  Fries are thick cut belgian style.  They were ok, but a bit darker than I'm used to having.  There are several dipping sauces that i liked more than the fries.  The one to try here is the one that has bacon in it.  I think it is the first one on the menu.  Besides a wide beer selection they also have a unique selection of non alcoholic drinks such as cucumber soda.  It has outdoor seating too which is great on cool night.  Neighborhood is artsy and reminds me of Williamsburg in NYC."

There was a small line, good enough to give us time to pick what we wanted.We got the sweet Filipino sausage w/ sauerkraut and the Kielbasa w/ grilled onions and a small fries w/ pesto mayo and chipotle mayo, no drinks. Came out to about $19. Kind of pricey, but again, they're \"gourmet.\" And this location is popping. So you're paying for both. The Filipino sausage was actually really good. I loved the sweet pork filling. It had a nice bite with the sauerkraut too. The fries were crispy and delicious. Dipping sauces were the bomb.

The discrete entrance leads into a crowded ordering area that leads into a larger, dimly lit dining area full of large communal tables, bars, and a live DJ playing groovalicious nu disco. How awesome is that!?Despite the seemingly long line outside the entrance, we waited a mere 20 minutes on a Saturday evening, 8 PM, during which we efficiently decided on the 5 wieners we wanted to split among 5 ladies (yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…). Upon entering the building, a waitress took down my friends' beer selections, which they cheerfully sipped on as we got closer to the register. If I knew a bit more about beer, I'd tell you about the excellent selection that they carry...but, quite frankly, I don't know anything, and can tell you nothing.We opted for 1 gourmet sausage ($6.50) and 4 exotic sausages ($8 each) (s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com…). CW from the top left: mango jalapeno, crocodile, rattlesnake, pheasant, rabbit. We tagged on a groot order of BELGIAN FRIES for $5.50, which meant a large portion of fries with a choice of 2 dipping sauces (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com…).The MANGO JALAPENO consisted of chicken, turkey, and apparently mango, though it tasted more like a spicy sweet chicken apple. The CROCODILE & PORK, ANDOUILLE was hickory smoked with a thick casing that was very tough indeed. It was decent, though there was a strange, unsettling taste that I couldn't quite place. The RATTLESNAKE & RABBIT WITH JALAPENO PEPPERS was mildly spiced and tasted of meatballs to me, whereas my friends said it reminded them of jerky. The PHEASANT WITH HERBS DE PROVENCE came off as a breakfast sausage to me, which I'm not a fan of in the first place. And the RABBIT, VEAL & PORK SEASONED WITH WHITE WINE was my favorite because it tasted the most familiar to me, especially among all these strange flavors :PThe caramelized onions and sweet bell peppers that we picked as hot dog toppings were fantastic. The hot dog bun is nothing outstanding, and neither are the fries. However, the two sauces we ordered are of note. The BLEU CHEESE WALNUT & BACON has generous chunks of fried bacon and feta cheese and was originally my favorite until it began climbing up the salty scale. The PESTO MAYO is delish, as one can imagine. Water and mustard are self-serve.Eating exotic wieners in a rambunctious warehouse while grooving to nu disco?Let me be the first to rename this place Bestkuche."

Try to beat the rush and you'll have a much more enjoyable meal! 1st time here I ordered the Hot Italian which was good - flavorful and had a little heat2nd time here: - Caracole Saxo - light and in an interesting cup.. - Louisiana Hot Link - nice flavor and juicy - Duck & Bacon - really good! Has a light smokey flavor - Rattlesnake & Rabbit - surprisingly good, I liked it more than the duck :x - Fries w/ Chipotle Aioli sauce - YUM! the Thai Peanut sauce was not good.. at all.I think this place is a bit overhyped by the hipsters but would come back eventually, probably not when it's too busy though. This is the type of place where you order at the front and take a number and find yourself a seat in the back. When it gets too crowded you end up sitting in front of strangers on the same table/bench (which can get awkward sometimes) and it's just ridiculously loud.."

For example, they have a beer that is brewed by monks!    As we entered, she promptly took our drink orders and got them for us right away.  Within 10 minutes after entering the restaurant, we ordered and went to search for a table.  The tables are organized in cafeteria styles, but there is a really nice patio outside.We like their variety of vegetarian sausages and their truffle fries.  I sometimes get the sausages without the buns so I can save more room for the truffle fries with the awesome dipping sauces.  The blue cheese dipping sauce is my personal favorite.  We were out of there in under one hour and felt very full and happy.  I definitely would recommend this place to all of my friends!"

From the first time I came about 4 years ago to now, the quality has remained the same, and by same I mean delicious. My favorite has always been the rattlesnake and rabbit. It's juicy and flavorful. Sometimes the exotic meats can be a little dry but not rattlesnake and rabbit. The bun is slightly larger than the link so I end up tearing some off. (hint hint, make bigger links) I never really order the basic sausages like brat or hot links because they don't taste that special to me and I feel you can get the same Whole Foods or something for a fraction of the price. Besides the sausages, the fries are a MUST get. They fry them perfectly to a crisp on the outside and creamy inside. I like the chipotle aioli dipping sauce the best. It's best to come during off peak or for lunch because I feel like it gets too dark and loud at night. Line can take a while during peak hours as well so expect to wait quite a while to order, but once you order it's usually pretty easy to find a seat. Most are big communal tables with butcher paper so just plop down with your food and beer and enjoy!"

You can add caramelized onions, spicy bell peppers, sweet bell peppers as a topping. The sausage also comes with fries that are amazing! You can also order some dipping sauces for the fries for .75 cents. I don't want to pay, but they're so good. I love getting the chipotle aioli and, sundried tomato mayo, and chipotle ketchup.

She had told the bartender that he had been drinking too much but we had barely shown up and they attempted to cut him off but I talked to one of the guys behind the bar and he understood.

When we got there we waited in line but nothing to crazy. The line moved fairly quickly. We ordered the rattlesnake & rabbit with sauerkraut, duck & bacon with sweet peppers and the Louisiana with caramelized onions and some fries with white truffle oil. The place was busy but we found a seat inside. They also have outside seating but it was a little cold. Our food was out fairly quickly about 15 minutes then it was time to enjoy. All dogs were good, flavor was great but the rattlesnake & rabbit was the best. My fiancée and I agreed that the dogs needed like some mayo or mustard on it but then again the sauces were on the table so we could have added it our selfs. We will definitely be back when we are around the area. Who doesn't like weird, crazy and delicious food."

LOL....Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapenyo Peppers - $7.50I imagined the snake slithering around my stomach trying to get the rabbit all the while I was digesting them haha! However, it didn't really cause a war in my tummy - it caused sheer delight! The sausage was amazingly great and so were the Belgian fries. I washed it all down with water. Thank you to the fabulous Phillip N. for treating me =) They have classic, gourmet and exotic sausages.Usually there is a long line to get in here but we came here at the right time and avoided it.The dining area is like a mess hall so get used to sitting next to strangers. The food is so good you just won't care - even if you are the greatest misanthrope. I know beer and sausages go together, and they have a great variety of beers here, but still I didn't have any.The Arts District was relatively unknown until recently. Places like Wurstkuche and The Pie Hole have changed that and the new megagigantic apartment complex called One Santa Fe nearby is going to make things even worse. Parking wasn't so difficult a while back but now it is sheer hell. Get ready to drive around and around till someone leaves. There is a lot nearby but you have to pay there.I love this place because I get to practice my German LOL - which I studied at UCSB. The word Wurstkuche means \"sausage kitchen\". I love to hear people try to pronounce it - especially my BF haha. It should be pronounced vuwst-kuu-he. Wurst should be pronounced like you have a potato in your mouth.The ch should sound like it does in the name Corey CHaim LOL. Some people pronounce it with an sh sound but it drives me up the wall even though parts of Germany do indeed pronounce it that way."

Wasn't packed at all and had plenty of open seating available (cafeteria style)Tried the Rattlesnake & Rabbit.. Man that sausage was freakin good! Mildly spicy, juicy and just pure perfection. For the toppings, I went the caramelized onions and jalapeños just for an extra kick of spice. Along with the sausage, I had the Belgian fries cooked in white truffle oil glaze. YUM! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are plenty of dipping sauces to choose from but since I'm such a huge ketchup fan, I just stuck with the regular ketchup. However, I did try the chipotle aioli & curry ketchup and thise two sauces seem to be the most popular. Nice large inexpensive selection of beer on tap so there will definitely be something for everyone to love. Brats, fries, beer, and hip ambiance...what more could one ask for?!"

Given the fact that lines can extend up to 30 min+, definitely not worth the wait. No wait? It's a great place to grab a quick, albeit expensive, bite. I appreciate how Japadog and Seoul Sausage get creative with their toppings to jazz it up quite a bit, but here it's limited to peppers, onions, sauerkraut.Admittedly, the other sausages are top-notch. I enjoyed the spiciness of the Austin. The belgian fries are also on-point -- perfectly golden brown, crispy, and so thick it's like eating a fry with mashed potatoes inside. The beer selection is sizeable with a focus on Belgians and German beers, and these glasses are enormous."

Well it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon and on our way to the Getty we wanted to grab lunch. First impression, there was a line out the door but things moved quickly. Servers will give you a menu and they will ask if you would like a beer or soda. Chef and I decided on an exotic sausage so he ordered the rattlesnake/rabbit while I got the rabbit/veal. We of course also got the Belgium fries as well. We headed to the back and seating was plenty. Some are individual tables some are communal. The food arrived promptly and I immediately pounced on it! Yum! Yum! Everything was good, however I really couldn't taste the rattlesnake. Overall a place worth coming back too!"

I love the homey, yet trendy, vibe of this hot dog establishment. They've got the gourmet sausage business down to an art. You can find everything from simple tasty bratwurst to exotic pheasant or alligator dogs. I've yet to try something I didn't love (though I haven't tried the veggie dogs yet - but my cousin did and said they were awe-some, so that sorta counts). Anyway, I love everything here from the options of toppings (caramelized onions belong on everything, in my opinion) and the myriad of sauces you can choose from (including an all-you-can handle sized squirt-bottle of almost every kind of mustard imaginable. Oh, and before I forget, let's discuss the FRIES. I don't know which divine creature makes its way down from the heavens to make these bad boys, but the fries here are TOO GOOD! I literally have to throw them at passers by so I don't eat them all myself (can't gain all them calories). So basically what I'm saying is go here ... order anything (you'll like it) and don't forget the fries. They also have interesting beverages for the adventurous - most recently I had a cherry ginger beer which was A-Mazing!Happy Eating :)"

But I didn't think there was anything super special about their hot dogs except for the fact that they are made out of different meats, like lamb, rabbit, snake etc. I also ordered s side of fries with truffle oil, dipped in pesto mayo and chipotle aioli. The fries were pretty good, and the pesto mayo goes perfectly with the truffle oil !"

I got the Rattlesnake and Rabbit dog with grilled onions and hot peppers. Very light and clean in taste, not heavy or greasy at all. Le Boyf got bratwurst with grilled onions and sweet peppers. Again, flavorful but not greasy.Belgian fries were awesome. Chipotle aioli was bomb. Blue cheese walnut and bacon dip was whatevers.We came when it was slow, which was nice. I can see it poppin' at night. I liked the large open space.I feel like beyond the variety in the kinds of dogs, it wasn't anything crazy or mind blowing in terms of flavor. Just lots of mustard selections, which I don't mind since I love mustard but it does feel like an illusion trick to distract people from what their meal is supposed to be. For all the hype, there wasn't much flavor. LA dirty dog wins this one."

BUT THEN - the man in the front distributing menus and highlighting all of the fabulous options sucked us in! Im happy he did convince us to give it a try as the food and the atmosphere were interesting/entertaining/delicious! Process includes ordering up front - walking down a long hallway that leads to the dining room (filled with beautiful wood and steel tables/chairs/benches), and awaiting food delivery (relatively fast and very friendly service). Then it's your turn to choose which of the available 5 or 6 sauces you prefer to smother your sausage and fries with (all flavor options are scattered among the tables - various versions of ketchup/mustard/other condiments)! We ordered the curry ketchup to accompany our fries (so good) and topped our bratwurst with mustard and ketchup (the grilled onions and peppers are great additions to any sausage, as well). A seemingly older euro-looking dude in a bright red Lacoste polo was deejaying the background music - watching him drink beer and excitedly choose the new track provided ample entertainment!   A casual, fun, and delicious time for all."

        "review": "After seeing so many reviews on this place, I made it a point to try it out for myself on the way back from a dayclub in Hollywood. The drive only took about 15 minutes from the heart of Hollywood. There is a lot of metered and some free street parking. There was a small lot nearby offering parking for $2 every 15 minutes. We arrived at 7pm on a Sunday and the seating area was packed but there was only a small line to order. We actually walked in from the wooden door on the street corner into the bar/seating area and were so confused. If you enter from there, walk through the brick hallway and you'll end up in a small room where the register is. Order at the register and take your number to the seating area. There are also take-home sausages available for purchase at the register.Sausages are offered in 3 categories: classic, gourmet, exotic. You are able to choose 2 toppings from: sauerkraut, grilled onions, sweet peppers, hot peppers. I went with the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño, topped with grilled onions and sweet peppers. Some reviews said the sausages were dry but this was super juicy and flavorful. The roll it came on was fresh and warm, and the toppings were nicely cooked. Really really tasty!! 4 types of mustard are offered on the tables, and fries with dipping sauces are also on the menu. I don't like mustard and am not a huge fan of fries so I didn't try either of those. My complaint that almost made me want to take my review down to 3 stars is that I was still hungry after. I just wish the sausage was bigger (lol) but then again I love large portions. The bar menu seemed like it had a very good variety of draft and bottled beers. I liked the rustic atmosphere with the brown paper covering the tables for the messy eaters. If I am in the area I'll be back for lunch and a beer but I wouldn't make a dinner out of it since the meal didn't leave me full."

The only thing is finding the place, its littlerally a hole in the wall..lol We mustve came before the dinner rush too, or else it probably wouldve been easier to find. But we waited outside for our friend for about 15 minutes and people started lining up before our eyes and in no time, the line snaked around the inside and wrapped outside along the wall.The line moved quick though, and they let you order drinks (beer) while youre waiting in line. I don't even remember what beer I ordered but I just asked for the strongest one, and it was pretty good lol, it came in a goblet/wine glass thing so I felt extra fancy. lolI guess this place is known for thier exotic susages, so I had to try the rattle snake and rabbit dog, and I got larges fries to go with it with Aoili (SUPERGOOD) and yogurt (eh) dipping sauce. The sausage was really good, but you couldve probably given me any kinda sausge and told me it was a rattle snake and I wouldnt have thought different. Nothing really stood out, but its def worth a try.The dining area is pretty dark though, so if you want a place to converse, I dunno about this place...maybe bring a lantern and some candles to brighten up your tables? lolOverall not bad, just a place to go, to say you tried something crazy lol"

The food was just as great as, and if not better than, I remembered it to be back at the Venice location. The Mango Jalapeño  and Hot Italian sausages were delicious, and their Belgian fries even better. Throw on some ketchup and gourmet mustard, sauerkraut/onion toppings, and dip fries into the Chipotle Aioli, then it all becomes a nearly perfect meal along with a Kölsch beer to down.

For those who have small stomachs like I do, trust when I say that this meal is deceptively filling.The bad thing about Wurstkuche is that it's usually packed, so go when you have some time to kill. Not only does it take awhile to order your sausage, but after paying, you still have to deal with finding an empty table! Damn you for being so popular!

I would give this a 5 star but the sausage size is a little lacking.  Ratio is a bit off.  Had it been a little bigger, 5 stars all the way.  For hungry individuals or those who can eat, you may want to order two sausages.  All in all, pay this place a visit and you'll understand why this place has over 5k of reviews.   Its out of this world delicious!"

I love all the different beer and soda options paired with the limited menu so you don't feel *too* overwhelmed.The seating is communal which can be a blessing or a curse, depending on your timing. They put all the different mustards out on the tables for you to pick and choose and they offer free (cucumber?) water which is also nice. The sausages for me though were much more basic than I had expected and I felt that they got lost in the massive rolls. The first and last bites are all bread! I tried the bratwurst (way too much nutmeg) the hot link (tasted as expected) and the duck & bacon (definitely the best of the three). My mom and brother both had the rabbit and rattlesnake and said it was so mild that everything else overpowered the flavor.I also thought the toppings (tried all of 'em) didn't really add anything special flavor-wise,  whereas the sauces that they offer for the french fries are much more interesting and complex.I wouldn't mind coming back because I thought the fries were outstanding. Unfortunately I couldn't drink at the time (womp, pregnantladyproblems) but I could definitely see myself coming back for beers and frites in the future. It's a bit out of my way though and the parking is definitely a pain so I think I would sooner check out the other location than come back to this one...although, this location is nice since the Pie Hole is directly across the street!"

A shocking pink colored drink that tastes like cotton candy. Definitely a recommend. Anyways, what I really love about Wurstkuche is the fries. Beer dipped fried fries. Huge cuts of it with a variety of sauces. Even the small size is enough to really fill you up. I got the chipotle aioli which is slightly spicy. Sometimes there's a DJ playing but even when there's not, music choices still good. But the main thing is that it's a great place to come with friends to get drunk and eat artisan sausages and fries."

What a difference 30 minutes can make. Get there early if you can!!! We ordered almost one of everything. But there were so many kinds it was a bit hard for me to remember everything. These were the memorable ones:Buffalo, Beef, & Pork with Chipotle Peppers - Everyone's favorite. Mango Jalapeño - Very Sweet. Didn't taste the heat from the jalapenosClassic Sausages $6.5Gourmet Sausages $7.5Exotic Sausages $8.5Belgian Fries $5.5We ordered 13 Sausages , 3 Fries, 1 wine , 6 beers , and 1 soda and our total was $180.

Sometimes even, if you're feeling daring enough, you'll come up on a great sausage! What's best about the dogs here is that the flavor of the meat doesn't get lost in the bun or amidst the onions, peppers, kraut and/or condiments. Just rabbity, lamby, snaky, veggie goodness. Or whatever your pleasure... The problem I do have, is of course, the cost of said deliciousness! So after $30 in the hole, I had to ask myself if it was really THAT good. And well,....not really. Sure they're tasty but you can also purchase them straight from the case and cook them at home, for a fraction of the cost.Now if I could just get those amazing fries they make down to a science!"

Even an Oscar Mayer would've been sufficient but I guess it's the experience. Get here early  because the place fills up quite quickly. I had VIP parking but I think it's because I got there before they even opened. The service was good though. One thing I must mention is that they don't say that a piece of hair is always included in there French fries. It was fried quite well so I didn't mind too much. I figured with the condiments they have table side that it would help the hair go down a little easier. I informed them of the hair and they brought out another tray of potatoes, hairless. One would think that the hairy fries would have made the hairless fries complimentary but I was mistaken. If anyone likes hairy fries this is the place for you. For sausage go to your refrigerator.

Not to mention I detested mustard before trying their mustard sauces at the table. the beers are so good, They have different glasses for each. Once you order they give you a number and you walk around to the back through a longish dark hall.There's some small tables but for the most part the tables are huge long ones where you are forced to sit next to people you don't know.

Unlike Pinks who try to hide their sausages through copious amounts of toppings, Wurstuche likes to keep its sausage center stage by offering a few simple toppings such as peppers and grilled onions. This is a great place for adventurous eaters and yes the rattlesnake and rabbit is a must try. For those non meat eaters they also have you covered with vegetarian options. Also a big plus here are the fries and the dipping sauce they offer with the fries! Oh not to mention they do have a pretty good beer selection which is truly a must for a hot dog place like this. It's one of LA's most popular eating spots for a reason guys! Check it out. Also the location is great because its right by the middle of LA's art district.

We topped the duck with sauerkraut and onion and the rabbit with spicy peppers and onion. They were delicious! I give them four stars only because they were too small for the bun. I really wish the toppings didn't take over the size of the sausage.We also shared their fries and now I wish we each got a large. Those things were awesome! It's been a long time since I've had fries and I'm glad I waited for these ones to break my celibacy. We dipped them in ketchup, some kind of aioli, brown mustard, their mayo concoction with bacon (THE BOMB), and their tomato basil one.I honestly could have ate them off the floor.

You walk in, and the moment you step inside, someone greets you and asks what you'd like to drink, pointing to their list of ~30 beers, mostly German and Belgian. They all have authentic-sounding German names, because as far as I can tell, they are all imported or something. German beers can come in liters (a stein) for twice the cost (usual serving is 1/2 liter), and a $20 deposit to make sure you return the stein. They offer you beer as soon as you step in because they know you'll be waiting a little while, standing (25 minutes for us) to order your bratwurst, fries, or dessert. They have three categories of bratwursts, general: regular kinds, vegetarian included, gourmet: i don't remember, but better sounding, and exotic: including rattlesnake, rabbit, pheasant, etc, for $6 general, $6.50 gourmet, and $8 exotic. you have 4 options for toppings, any 2 are complimentary. These include caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, and spicy peppers. There are four mustard options to top it with as well. The fries were perfect. Decent amount, perfectly cooked, exquisitely seasoned. Two sizes. I haven't tried their dessert yet, but I've never been a fan of German desserts (yes, even German chocolate cake). Regardless, I need to try it again, based on their other foods. We went on a Friday night, which explains the wait, but it also explains the awesome DJ that was playing at, surprisingly, a volume that wasn't blasting my ears off. I will certainly be returning, the only question is when, and with how many friends."

I ordered the duck and bacon and their limited time gummy bear bratwurst to share with my friends. The duck and bacon is very savory yet slightly salty. It has a nice hint of bacon after taste. Unfortunately, the gummy bear bratwurst is not a fan favorite. I sadly did not get a gummy bear in my portion when divided. The consensus is that the gummy bear is weird.

Oh, can't forget the fries.Out of all of them, I think my favorite has to be the Mango Jalapeno. It's tender and sweet with a mild kick at the end. Delicious. The Pheasant, I'd say would be next, it's juicy and flavorful. The Bockwurst is mushier version of the Brat, I'd recommend the latter for a fuller flavor. I tried the Rattlesnake-Rabbit one just for the experience. It was tough, peppery and gamey. I don't think I'll be having that again, but it was a thrill.The ambiance is fantastic. Set up like a hipster bar, most of the seating is communal, so you'd either have to reach over someone else or ask them to to pass the mustard.Lots of beer on tap, and some more in bottles.

From the outside, the place looks like a small to go lunch spot. I had no idea there was a place to sit in the back, until one of the waiters pointed it out for us. The decor is modern and sleek, but feels cold from all the metal and lack of color. I did like the designs they had for the numbers.  We ordered the veal bockwurst and the rattle snake and rabbit with sweet peppers and caramelized onions for toppings. Our food came out quickly with excellent service. I was actually surprised by the size of my bockwurst. It's about the size of a small hotdog. For $6.50, I was expecting to be filled at the very least. The veal bockwurst was tender and juicy, but did not have much flavor besides the toppings. The rattle snake and rabbit had a great spicy kick to it and made for a better meal. I did like trying out all the different mustards they had to offer from grainy to honey, which made eating more experimental and fun. I recommend the spicy mustard for anyone ordering the veal. It adds the flavor needed to this plain sausage. I'd probably come back here with a large group of friends for some more adventurous eating since I have been eyeing the buffalo/ pork and the belgian fries."

I love that Wurstkuche is a really casual spot for a chill evening but it's still lively since it attracts a crowd. Ordering is simple at the counter and they offer a wide variety of sausages ranging from gourmet, exotic, and simple. I always go for the duck bacon sausage because it is just loaded with a flavor that I love. Everyone I've been here with has loved the sausage they order as well. I'm not too sure if I'd try the rattlesnake but I'll never say never :) the Belgian style fries are super good and they have a bunch of dipping sauces to choose from to accompany the fries. After ordering, walking to the back is a big surprise. I'd never guess how big the seating area is from looking at the outside but there are big community tables along with smaller tables. The best part is that they have a bar in the back so you can grab a beer throughout any point in your meal. Definitely a smart move to avoid sending customers back to the line at the front. Eating at Wurstkuche is always a good time. The hardest part about eating here is deciding which sausage to try, but I bet you can't go wrong!"

When it came down to it, the sausage just didn't blow my mind...I wanted the Filipino sausage but they were out, so I took the cashier's suggestion of the lamb sausage, which I'd also been eyeing. Got it topped with caramelized onions. The bread was more than just a bun, and although I liked the softness, it totally overtook the sausage. You get a variety of sauces to top your sausage at the table, which I liked. The fries lack any seasoning, so make sure you choose the dipping sauces wisely. The bleu cheese was a winner; pass on the chipotle ketchup. You can use the ketchup and many mustards at your table to spice it up.Maybe I'll give this place another shot and order a beer, as people seem to be raving about those. But for the sausage alone... I was not as impressed as I wanted to be. Do I have to try the most exotic flavors to be blown away? I'll go for the rabbit or alligator next time and let you know."

        "review": "Exotic sausages only. I'm been going to Wurstkuche for years and I seriously am always down to come back for the exotic sausages, mustards, amazing fries, and all the beers. So basically everything. I stay stuntin' on that rattlesnake and rabbit. There aren't a lot of places in California where you can get that combination... or have it be as delicious as it is. The fries (usually) are perfectly crisp on the outside and well-cooked potato-y goodness on the inside. Dip it with the chipotle aioli and the variety of mustards.That's probably my favorite thing about Wurstkuche (besides having the exotic sausages): the variety of mustards. I can never really make a solid decision between whole grain, dijon, honey, and spicy. So I happily alternate.I generally love the ambiance but it gets a little hard when the place is packed and you're trying to have a conversation with someone. Also, the line can get a little crazy but it for sure is worth it."

Waited for 30+ minutes to place our order.BRATWURST W/ CARAMELIZED ONIONS AND HOT PEPPERS:Not bad, the hot peppers add to the nice kick that the bratwurst provides. A bit pricey for what it is at $6.RATTLESNAKE AND RABBIT SAUSAGE W/ CARAMELIZED ONIONS AND HOT PEPPERS:Overhyped and overpriced, in my opinion.  Got this one after hearing about it all over Yelp. The meat was a bit tougher than the bratwurst but nothing really discernible in terms of taste to separate it from other types of normal sausages that I've tried before. For $8 a pop definitely not worth it.GROOT FRIES:Large fries with your choice of two dipping sauces. I chose the buttermilk ranch and the chipotle aioli. The sauces complimented the fries well, and the fries were thick, greasy and good. For those of you that prefer the thin cut fries like the ones at McDonald's, bummer.Overall, a cool place to hang out with the friends and decent food but way too overpriced for the amount of food that you get. I will never go out of my way to come back here, only if I find myself in the neighborhood and the line isn't ridiculously long. Finding parking on a Saturday night is downright atrocious, it took me nearly 30 minutes to find street parking."

(That was a joke by the way...cuz otherwise I would have serious medical issues and would probably need to see a doctor if I could really do that with my bellybutton).  The seating area is in the back and opens to a huge room with picnic bench style seating, a nice large bar in the back, and a dj playing tunes while you eat and hang out.  Very chill atmosphere and def worth checking out if youre in DTLA."

The sauerkraut wasn't anything really spectacular. I do have high standards for the pickled cabbage and prefer it to be a little spicy. The pheasant hot dog was delicious. I've never had pheasant before but the skin coating the hot dog was very light and easily broken into. The meat was juicy and tender. The bun was white bread and grilled on the fryer. It was large enough the encase the entire hot dog which is not something that happens very often. If you've ever wondered why hot dogs are so messy it's because the buns are too small the good stuff doesn't have a pocket to sit in. The spicy peppers, sauerkraut, and mustards (Dijon and Brown) did not fall out this time and it was delicious."

It could have been the Italian though, you should ask.I don't like that they squish the veggie dogs right up with the actual meat ones, but hey, can't win them all.Awesome beer selection just like in Venice, and if the line is out the door like it was when we went, they will get you a beer as soon as you walk in the door (still in line), unless you want a litre that is."

We shared both and they tasted amazing!! The rattlesnake was so juicy and nicely charred. The pheasant was mixed with herbs and tasted really clean and distinct. We also ordered beer at the bar which is in the dining area. I opted for franziskaner and I forgot what my homie ordered. They were both around $6 and its a half liter!

You shall find this German bar / food court fusion cafe in the heart of the LA's Arts District. Just place your order, grab a number, and one of the staff will bring the food to your table. Staff was absolutely fantastic - they were all friendly and courteous. Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers ($8): Don't be afraid! It might sound exotic, but it tasted just like your typical sausages. Honestly, you can't really taste the difference between rattlesnake and rabbit because they are all mixed together. I didn't fell in love with this sausage, but it was still pretty decent.Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers ($8): Did not like this as much as rattlesnake & rabbit sausage. I can't really taste the bacon ...Belgian Fries (tzatziki and chipotle aioli, groot $5.5): Great dipping sauces and amazing crunchy fries. Sometimes it is just good to forget how much calories you are consuming.I will probably come back here for another round of exotic sausages. Yes buffalo / beef / pork sausage, I got my eyes on YOU.P.S. - The staff told us that Wurstküche is no longer selling alligator sausages because the company who made these sausages ran out of business (not enough alligator eaters).

        "review": "Leave it to LA to take something as simple as a sausage and turning it into a talking point. Wurstküche isn't as much German as it is a creator of franken-sausages. The sausages are divided into three categories: classic, gourmet, and the exotics. You then get a choice of two toppings, which includes caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers. Why drive a Honda when you can drive a Lamborghini? Of course you're going to go for the exotics. In reality, you're actually driving a Lamborghini with a Honda engine. I tried the popular rattlesnake & rabbit with jalapeno peppers. There was nothing actually special about the sausage itself. There was no distinctive rattlesnake flavor that stood out. In essence, I had paid $7.50 for a showboat hotdog. While the sausage itself was pretty juicy, the plain, bland baked roll was unappetizing. I also tried a bite of the Filipino marharlika, which was sweet pork with natural seasonings. It didn't taste much different from the rattlesnake & rabbit. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the Belgian fries. A small includes one dipping sauce, while a large includes two. I tried the curry ketchup, which was strangely addicting. Apparently, the wait can get long, but it wasn't too bad on a Sunday evening. It was convenient to order and then find a spot out on the patio. Communal seating inside can be a little tougher to snag. Wurstküche is worth a try only if you're in the area and already have parking; otherwise, move along because there's nothing much to taste here."

        "review": "This is less about the food, and more about a really disturbing experience I had at Wurstkuche 2 nights ago: I had been out singing karaoke with a couple friends (we're all adults in our 30s), and we decided we were hungry, and so went to Wurstkuche. We got our sausages and beers, and while eating, a woman at the next table came up to us, said that she was on a date with a man who felt dangerous and who had taken her phone, and asked us to call her a cab. We obviously called her a cab right away, and walked her outside to wait for it. While walking out, the men she was with followed us out, and basically wouldn't let her leave the bar. It was really fucking creepy. One of my friends tried to simply get in between the man and this woman who had asked her for help, standing between them. At this point, the restaurant staff started yelling at my *friend,* telling her to get away from the creep who was bothering the woman who had come up to us. The dude was seriously a CREEP. We tried to explain to the staff what had happened.  and not only did they refuse to listen to us, they proceeded to get security to ask us to leave. We asked them again and again to just listen to the story of the woman coming up to us to ask for help, and they told us that the only \"problem\" they saw was our friend putting herself between the creep and the woman who asked us for help. We asked them if they would at least keep an eye on the situation, and they literally said, \"She's drunk, and those guys seem fine.\"As anyone reading this knows, it is a rare thing to have a stranger approach you and ask for help because of a dangerous situation. I have never been at a bar where a woman came up to me and asked to be put in a cab because her companion was dangerous. Even if it wasn't \"really\" an emergency, if someone is going to walk up to a total stranger and ask them to call them a cab for her, it's a situation worth taking very seriously. While we understood that the staff could not necessarily do anything about it, the way the staff kept ignoring the testimony of three people-- 3 women, incidentally-- and privileging the deeply fucking creepy testimony of 2 random men, was a nightmare to see. It wasn't *just* that they wouldn't believe us, it was that they also had us kicked out for \"starting problems.\" When we expressed concern about the safety of the woman who came up to us, they told us, repeatedly, \"she's drunk.\" One barback went so far to listen in and then toss over his shoulder at us, \"Not all guys are like that.\" Yeah, not all guys *are* like that. The staff at the Wurstkuche, however, *are*. Ultimately, me and my two friends were asked to leave the bar, and we went home not knowing if the woman who asked us for help was okay. We took the cab she had asked us to call for her. As we know, we live in a culture where more than 2/3 of women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. We need to live with that reality in our minds and constantly work on acting differently in moments like the one I describe above. Again, while the Wurstkuche staff could not necessarily *do* anything about the situation, their response was disgusting, misogynist, and dangerous. Even if everyone involved was drunk-- and it was midnight at a BAR-- that's not an excuse to ignore a situation that someone has reported as dangerous. Furthermore, the way that the staff refused to listen to 4 women-- my two friends, me, and the woman reporting danger-- over the voices of 2 fucking creepy men was egregious, and such bald testimony to the fact that this is not a place where women can hang out. My review, in short, for my sisters: Don't go to Wurstkuche, don't spend your money there, don't drink there, don't take your friends there, don't spend your time there. This place is run by misogynist assholes, and we live in an enormous, amazing city with great food and drink, and millions of other places that don't actively invest in date rape culture to frequent. Stay away!"

One girl with short pink hair sprayed more oil on the fries for us which was nice of her to do (and she was the only nice employee), but that didn't help anything. Just an excuse to jack up the price. But besides the food, my sister and I just received dirty looks from all of the white employees like we didn't belong. Not inclusive at all. Like they're not used to seeing black people or have never seen a black person before. The lady at the register acted like she didn't want to take our order and rolled her eyes at us for no reason. Then they kept staring at us like we were going to rob the place or something. Like, I just asked for a hot dog and fries not all of the money in the cash register, relax. I hate to leave a bad review, but I don't take well to customers being treated differently compared to other customers. And it extends past the employees to the customers as well.

I only give 4 for things that really rise to the occasion, and the competition can be stiff. They absolutely nailed it as far as my Franziskaner beer goes. Along with their magnificent Belgian Fries, lengthy hours (open til 1:30a every day), location, and cool atmosphere that includes a DJ whipping out some beats, I should be a big time fan. But, I'm not going to beat around the büsh. This might be hard to swallow, but I must bring up that I've never been much of a sausage guy. It's nothing to start an uprising over though, so when I made plans to meet up with some friends in The Arts District and they wanted to check out Wurstküche, I sucked it up and went along for the ride, instead of pulling out.After being granted entry and grabbing a menu, I glanced at their extensive options but nothing immediately popped out. There was a Hot Italian and a Vegetarian Mexican, but I had to take my eyes off the other patrons and decide what to order. They say \"Everything is Bigger in Texas\" so I got the Austin Blues ($6.50) gourmet sausage with hot peppers and caramelized onions. The Austin Blues was actually of average size, although the toppings were plentiful to the point I couldn't see the sausage under them. I could've easily downed 2, but wasn't interested in double fisting. Maybe they should look into offering enlargements instead. The menu describes the Austin Blues as \"hot and spicy, tri-pepper and hardwood smoked pork.\" Now, I wasn't expecting to be blown away, but was a bit let down that it wasn't massively spicy.  After my first bite or 2 I was hoping it'd grow on me, but it never did. At least it came quickly (service was on point, even during the peak on a Friday night). It wasn't messy either."

All my buns were kinda dry, not moist or tasty. I liked bratwurst. Both veggie dogs were ok, although I just had leftover veggie dogs at home on the next day, and they tasted better than yesterday.. or maybe I was just hungry.So the reason I rated 1 star is because of the rude cashier girl. So my total was $19.62. I used $18 gift card so I had to pay $1.62. First, I gave her $2.02. But then I saw $0.10 in my wallet so I gave her $0.10 extra so I get $0.50 back instead of $0.60 back. She gave me $0.48 back. I told her, I gave her  $2.12 so I should get $0.50 back. She told me back, \"no, I didn't get $0.02. I only got 2.10.\" I told her back, \"no, I gave you $0.02\".

Having a sausage fest was not cool.  How times have changed over the years. I have had Wurstkuche bookmarked for the past year or so. I arrived at 11:30 AM.  But, no parking was to be found.  I circled around the block several times, but, no luck.  I didn't want to park in the $10 lot across the street.  20 minutes later, I found my parking spot and quickly ran inside to try to beat the lunch rush.  I ordered a Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Pepper sausage, and a Hot Italian sausage. The cashier helped me choose the toppings.  After paying $16, I saw the chef throw the sausages on the grill.  I then went to the dining room and took a seat.  The sausages came out about 10 minutes later.  The Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers came with onions and spicy peppers.  I ate rattlesnake before.  Yes, I am one of those who thinks it tastes like chicken.  But, it was my first time eating rabbit.  The combination of rattlesnake and rabbit worked well.  It was delicious.  If I had know that rabbit had such a good taste, my wife's pet rabbit would no longer be a pet, but, dinner.  The Italian Sausage came with Sweet Peppers.  It also was delicious.  The water here is self serve.  There are a couple of water stations where you can get your own water.  The water is infused with cucumber.  It wasn't really my thing.  I thought it tasted funny. It is nice to see how the area has changed for the better.  Wurstkuche is a welcome addition to this neighborhood.  I plan on coming back to Wurstkuche soon for another Sausage fest.  I can't believe that I have been missing out!"

Line can be long at times, but it moves quickly if people aren't asking a bunch of questions about the menu when they get to the counter. I've tried a bunch of the exotics, which are yummy, but I stick to the hot italian (which is spicier than the Austin Blues btw) with sweet peppers and caramelized onions. Try their fries! Thick cut and come out piping hot - $2 extra for truffle oil which TOTALLY makes a difference!You can order a beer while you're waiting in line, but there's also a bar in the eating area. Order your food, get a number, pick a seat and wait for the deliciousness to come to you. Indoor and outdoor seating available, outdoor seating is doggie friendly! Condiments are communal and self serve so go hunt down whichever bottles catch your fancy. Parking is street, but I usually walk over from my bf's place. Online ordering is available as well!"

        "review": "***NOTE: was sober when consuming food***Ordered Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage & Mango JalapeñoThe mango jalapeño had a subtle not overpowering spice. I liked the bun, which was nicely toasted and better than just your average. I couldn't finish the apple sage though... I wanted to experiment with something different (which I recommend!), but I ended up not liking it. Of course, it doesn't and shouldn't taste like meat, but it was missing the savory note and had an unappetizing flavor. The ginger beer is gooooood (non-alcoholic) [expensive]- like a soda with a ginger kick.They have a lot of long picnic tables - it's chill but can be a little dark if you go at night. Perhaps it might be better for a date.  I might give it a 3.5 for the taste of the mango jalapeño, but overall, the hot dogs are not satisfying/delicious enough to make me want to pay $8-$9 per dog.  If you're feeling adventurous and want to try some unique meats like lamb and rattle snake sausages, you might want to try this place out."

Their fries are a thicker cut and were super out of the fryer hot and crispy.  The blue cheese / walnut sauce was chunky and hard to coat the fries with.  I didn't taste much blue cheese flavor, but it was creamy and nutty if you get a piece of walnut on your fry.  Chipotle aioli was just that.I really liked the layout of this place.  They have a showcase of all the different types of sausages.  Then you walk towards the back past the restrooms to their spacious bench seating area.  There are a variety of mustards to choose from at the tables and self serve water and utensil station.  Very clean and inviting.  Definitely coming back!"

This place consistently has lines out the door but the lines usually go by pretty quickly. Once you enter the restaurant, you see a display of sausages in the window. All have a label on it that clearly describe all of the ingredients inside of the dog. They have everything you could possibly imagine - vegetarian options, exotic options (rattlesnake and rabbit, duck and bacon, pheasant with herbs, etc.) and your traditional hot dogs such as Louisiana hot links, Italian, etc. And you can sip on a nice cold Belgium beer while you wait too. After you place your order, you take your number and step into their back dining room area where they have another bar and plenty of spots to sit. I like how although this place is still very casual, they bring your food to the table and check to see if you need anything else. FOOD:I've tried a few of their sausages but I always go back to their duck and bacon. I get mine topped with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. The flavors are packed! Very savory and I like how there is a nice snap when you bite into the hot dog. They also have an array of mustards you can put on top of your dog. I am crazy for their spicy mustard which is slightly spicy but won't over power the actual flavors of the dog. Trust me, go with the duck and bacon. You will not regret it!And of course, you must get an order of their famous fries with truffle oil. Yes, get it with the truffle oil. You have to! For a large, you get only two options for sauces. They have so many unique flavors you will have a hard time to pick. I really liked their chipotle aioli and blue cheese with walnut and bacon. These fries have the perfect texture since they are double fried.   They seriously hit the spot every single freaking time. I think a large order is perfect for two people to share. Especially if you are a french fry fanatic like me, it will be easy to kill.PARKING:Can be rather tricky. Overall, if you love fries, beer, and hot dogs, Wurstuche will be your spot. But who doesn't like any of those 3 things...?!"

I usually get sick of things like that after half but this one I devoured the entire thing. I also tried my friends duck jalapeño one and that one was also really good but more on the heavier side. The place is self seating and you order your food in the front first and the servers bring it to you. I can't tell if I love or hate their fries.

From regular bratwurst to exotic rattlesnake and alligators, there's a fairly diverse selection of sausages to choose from. Whatever you choose though, please get a side of fries, they're delicious and only made more delicious by their selection of dipping sauces. Don't forget about their other sauces used for sausages!In case you haven't entered Wurstküche's interior yet, the front is pretty small where you order, but you can order a drink while you wait in line! Once you head back into the dining area, oh it's suddenly spacious and often has a DJ playing songs. It's dim lighting but it's cozy in my opinion.

Just walking in front of the place just gives you this European vibe to the place. The line was pretty long when we were there and the workers were pretty nice giving us people in line a menu to look over and they also offered any drinks while we wait in lineI ordered the Keilbasa with sauerkraut and caramelized onions. The sauerkraut was a little sour as expected which overpowered the taste of the caramelized onions. The Keilbasa sausage itself had plenty of taste to it which tasted really great. Oh and btw after you order, you walk through the long hallway and make it to this big room with rows of long benches. Made it feel like I was eating in a cafeteria in elementary school or something and tables on the side as well but they were all full which forced us to sit in the benches. The benches had paper over them which made it possible for kids to write on them. Anyway this place is pretty cool. Would come back to it."

It was our lunch spot, crazy as it sounds since we're all chefs and we literally learn/work in kitchens! But Wurskuche is the place to be when you need that sausage and drink FIX! I will say this..if you eat MEAT, then GROW UP and try the EXOTICS! My TOP 3 Meat:-DUCK with bacon-Rabbit and Pork-Rattlesnake and RabbitThe best VEGETARIAN sausage for me would have to be the V. Smoked Apple Sage. The sausages are always cooked to order and oh so fresh and juicy in every bite! I always put the caramelized onions and sauerkraut for toppings. You can also choose from spicy peppers and sweet peppers. (peppers=BELLPEPPERS)I've never had their beers but instead, my go-to is the Manhattan Special Sarsaparilla! It's a bit sweet so I typically water it down. They have the BOX WATER or free water--CUCUMBER WATER--so delicious and refreshing. The Sarsaparilla tastes exactly like the Filipino RC soda or Sarsi! MUSTARDS GALORE! I used to not be into mustards but I learned to like it. I don't put a whole lot but when I eat it, I like the HONEY MUSTARD! Wurskuche provides others like WHOLE GRAIN, DIJON, SPICY BROWN AND AMERICAN YELLOW. I'm adventurous when it comes to food but BOY, these mustards are NO JOKE! Try them lightly. The line to order used to not even reach the outside back in 2012. The wait was never 10 minutes minimum neither! It's no shock that word got around of this BOMB AF spot in the ARTS DISTRICT! If you've never been, JUST GO and be open-minded about the exotics. FINDING PARKING WILL BE THE END OF YOU  (: HEHEHEHE!"

(Right across from Angel City Brewery) We walked in at 730ish pm on a Thursday. A woman handed us a menu and there was about 3 people in front of us. We quickly decided we wanted to do exotic brats. We couldn't agree on two, so we got three to share. :) We picked rattlesnake & rabbit, duck & bacon, and pheasant. We also got some truffle fries. I got a liter of Vitus (7.7%) and DELICIOUS, he got a Chimay White (8%) and later a Hopfen-Weiss (8.2%). When you order the liters of beer they hold your credit card, so be sure to bring back the mug to close out. The seating in the back was pretty packed, we found the only empty table, so I guess we got lucky. The food was brought to us in less than 10 minutes. The pheasant was both of our favorites, followed by the duck, and lastly the rabbit and rattlesnake. The pheasant was just so packed with flavor and juices, I can see myself travelling for this meal often. Highly recommend checking this place out."

In line we waited probably around 10 mins and for food around the same 10-15 mins. When we were leaving a bit before 9pm it was even longer the line and the sitting area was definitely popping. Someone had reserved a more enclosed area for a birthday surprise so it looks like you can hold private events. It certainly did feel like I was walking into a club since they had a live DJ at the center and the lights are dimmed. The seating is cafeteria style, you have the option to pick wherever you want to sit. Coming from NYC I'm not use to this style of procedure where you first order then they bring out your food based on your number but it works. They had extra condiments laid out on the table all kind of mustard and ketchup. We ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapeño peppers (buttery & juice) and Rabbit and Pork with Leeks and Carrots (clean and light). You also get to add two toppings I chose sweet peppers and caramelized onions since I can handle spice and I wasn't sure how spicy their spicy peppers can get. The sausage was good and decent size. Mine didn't feel heavy like after eating Nathans. We got a large Belgian fries to share and chose two sauces: Chipotle Aioli (highly recommended) and Buttermilk Ranch (taste is lighter).If you are looking for a casual night out I would recommend coming here, they also have patio sitting as well. When we were leaving the bus boys were very attentive so tables open up before you know. Also they have a bar inside, I had a non alcoholic drink, the ginger beer since I wanted ginger ale which was a good substitute."

They accept cash and credit. When you stand in line somebody usually hands you a menu and ask if you want to drink. After, you order you get your number. Don't worry about seating because if you walk down the dark hallway and open the left door you be transported to their bar/eating area. On the weekends they have a dj mixing some tunes. Food I had triedevery hotdog you get  you pick two toppings: caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers Buffalo, Beef & Pork With Chipotle Peppers- If your into spicy I totally recommend you get this. I really like the taste of this and when I bite into this I could really taste the smoked chipotle. Duck & Bacon With Jalapeno Peppers- You can never go wrong with bacon and duck. This is not too spicy and I like how savory the duck and bacon hotdog is.Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers- I never knew how tasty rattlesnake and rabbit are! I ask the cashier and she said this is one of the most popular picks. Super tasty and I think everyone who comes here should get this!Belgian fries- I usually get the large one to share and it comes with 2 sauces. My favorite sauces I like to pair my fires with are Chipotle Aioli and Pesto Mayo. Chipotle aioli has a little kick to it which I like. I love pesto and the pesto mayo is delicious with the Belgian fries.Hopefully this is convincing for you to come try this place out !"

        "review": "When I first went here I believed I was missing out on something in life - these exotic sausages and the German and Belgian beers! Then, I went here a couple of times and the excitement died down. Don't get me wrong- the sausages are delicious and there is definitely novelty involved. How many places actually sell sausages that use rattlesnake for meat?! Yet after I tried all the different types of sausages throughout the year, I did not feel as if I \"yearned\" for this place.I'm not giving this place the full 5-stars because I wouldn't necessarily drive all the way from OC to LA just for this. If I'm in the area and I can't think of anywhere to go, I may just come and dine here but it doesn't necessarily mean I'm an all-time fan. The low-down on my foods:- Pheasant sausage - 4 stars - It's pretty good. You definitely can taste the herbs that were made with the sausage.- Fries - 3 stars. If you get them plain (like I did), you've made a mistake. Make sure you tell them to put truffle oil on top! Also if you get small, you only get one dipping sauce while if you order a large you get two dipping sauces.Also beware - parking on the weekends is definitely hard as it is mostly street parking. They're usually all taken!"

A must try!  If you love a good sausage on a roll with great  toppings like grilled onions peppers and kraut and need to wash it down with a cold beer this is the place for you. I had the buffalo sausage my pal had the rattle snake and rabbit (not sure if they're added separate or if one ate the other), he said it was surprisingly mellow and not 'unusual' except for the name.  There are an abundance of sauce selections both at the table (variety of mustards and reg. Ketchup) and when ordering.  Dipping sauce comes with fries. I liked the chipotle mayo and my pal liked the sun dried tomato mayo.  He said the chipotle ketchup was for the birds but he only likes Heinz... (And he's a bit of a tool, so try it for your self).  Bartender was awesome!!! Explained the beer selection and made suggestions based on our preferences.  I'll be back."

        "review": "This review is way overdue.THE AMBIANCE:Love, love, love, Wustküche! You walk in to a small wait-in-line-to-order lounge where a staff member hands you a two-sided paper menu (food/drinks) and asks you if you want something to drink. PERFECT. You grab a nice cold one as you gaze into the glass case holding the many different creations of sausages. You pay at the counter and they give you a stand-up, metal, red number sign. When you're done paying you walk down a hallway to the main dining area that is park-style; in other words you are eating on wood benches. There is additional elevated seating and a bar where you can continue to order drinks. I have not purchased anything other than beer to drink because sausages and beer go together just so wonderfully. Wurstküche provides its patrons with a steel water dispenser and glass cups to calm the buzz. Wurstküche also provides its patrons with a great ambiance -- friendly people, great music, and delicious food.THE FOOD:The selections are as follows:(1) Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella $7 - Smoked chicken and turkey(2) Austin Blues $7 - Hot, spicy, tri-pepper and hardwood-smoked pork(3) Mango Jalapeño $7 - Chicken and turkey(4) Chicken, Apple, & Spices $7 - Two chicken and apple sausages with a speck of cinnamon (pork-free)(5) Vegetarian Italian $6 - Fennel, garlic, red peppers, and eggplant(6) Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle $6 - Chipotle, arbol chilies, garlic, and onions(7) Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sage $6 - Apples, Yukon potatoes, and rubbed sage(8) Hot Italian $6 - Fine cuts of organic GMO-free pork and spices(9) Bockwurst $6 - Veal, pork, and spices(10) Santa Fe Jack Cheese & Jalapeño Peppers *** (Might be discontinued)(11) Louisiana Hot Link $7 - Beef and pork with onions and hot spices(12) Kielbasa $7 - Polish-style pork and beef with onions and spices(13) Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers $8 - Buttery and mildly spicy(14) Duck and Bacon with Jalapeño Peppers $8 - Succulent and packed with flavor(15) Rabbit, Veal, & Pork $8 - A light and delicate sausage seasoned with white wine(16) Filipino Maharlika $7 - Sweet pork with natural seasonings(17) Buffalo, Beef, & Pork with Chipotle Peppers $8 - Smoky chipotle flavor(18) Bratwurst $6 - Fine cuts of pork with coriander and nutmeg(19) Lamb with Mediterranean Spices $8 - Two flavorful and completely pork-free sausagesWhen you order a sausage it comes with a roll and your choice of two (2) toppings from a choice of caramelized onions, sweet peppers, spicy peppers and sauerkraut. I have tried a good amount of the sausages here. I don't like strong spicy foods and for me the Austin Blues, Mango Jalapeño, and Louisiana Hot Link were way spicy for me. My top pick so far is the Buffalo, Beef, & Pork with Chipotle Peppers. Just wow! It is so flavorful, juicy, and it has a small spicy kick, which I enjoyed. The fries are pretty good here - big, thick, and double-dipped they say. The fries come in a small size (Klein $3.50) or a large size (Groot $5.50) and with dipping sauces. One (1) sauce for the Klein and two (2) sauces for the Groot. Each extra sauce is 50 cents. I would recommend getting two (2) sides of the Chipotle Aioli. It is fantastic. Your dining bench has bottles of ketchup and different types of mustard that you can enjoy as well. For dessert, Wurstküche offers a Toasted Apple Pie Ice Cream Sandwich on oatmeal raisin cookies. I have never tried the dessert because I don't like apples and bread together. THE TIPS:There is now a parking lot next to a church right across the street where you pay a max of $10.00. It is worth it because looking for parking in this area is frustrating and tiresome. Once you are done dining here, burn some calories by walking down the street to Angel City Brewery where you can regain what you just burned but won't regret it."

        "review": "My two cents: It's good, but not worth waiting in line for 30 minutes to order good. I've been here a few times and it doesn't matter what night of the week it is, the line will spill out onto the street. This is because Wurstkuche is a hipster establishment, coupled with the fact that they only have one guy taking orders. They really need to get a second register going to take orders in a more timely fashion so the hipsters can get their hipster sausages faster. But then again, perhaps the winding line builds the suspense and hype.I love the sausages here. They're all good. Nice sear, good selection of toppings, freshly baked buns. My favorite is the mango jalapeno, but the duck and bacon and rattlesnake are also delicious for the more adventuresome palate. They even have vegetarian options! Priced at $6.50-$8.00, I think it's fair for a trendy place like this. Overall, lots of (deserved) hype, great selection of beer, sucky parking (the lot is $10 or pray to the parking gods for street parking), long lines and a loud messhall-like dining area. Tips: Must order food at the counter, but can order drinks at the counter or at the bar in the dining hall. Go to the Pie Hole across the street for dessert!"

I liked putting on the honey mustard & Dijon Mustard on it - they have 4 or 5 different options of mustards which I would recommend to try them all! My boyfriend had the Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppers, which was equally delicious and flavorful as well.  We shared the Belgian Fries w/ the Whtie Truffle Oil Glaze and ordered the Chipotle Ketchup which was yummy! Although the wait was about half an hour to place an order, I think it is definitely worth the wait if you have the time to spare.  Great food, great atmosphere and also close to a few neat bars!"

The place looks small but when you walk down the hallway there's a big open space with all kinds of community and more private tables for you to choose from. There's even a bar for you to sit at and get a drink in the case you want something a little harder than the fruit drinks they sell. Though I must say I really did like the cherry soda I got.I menu is fairly simple, you have a choice of classics, gourmet and exotic sausages. I got the rabbit and snake sausage, which is on the exotic list. Once you pick your sausage you have two choices of either; caramelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers or hot peppers. I did the caramelized onions and sweet peppers! I got to say, I enjoyed my sausage a lot. It was good, filling and the caramelized onions and sweet peppers were great; added some nice favors to the meaty sausage. The snake and rabbit was a good pick! I would like to see and taste what else they have the next time I go! And the Belgian fries were excellent, we had the pesto mayo and buttermilk ranch, both great dipping sauces for the fries!"

Although I do not doubt how delicious other menu items are, as a pescatarian, I'm obviously limited in my choices. However, Wurstküche has an accommodating menu with THREE vegetarian options. Don't overlook the Mexican Chipotle just because it may not be as exotic as other menu items. It's delicious! They also serve their sausages on a freshly baked roll, while allowing you to add two of the four following options to any order: spicy peppers, sweet peppers, caramelized onions, and sauerkraut. They also have gourmet mustards, in the back for self serve which include: whole grain, dijon, spicy brown, honey mustard, american yellow, and ketchup. As a mustard LOVER, this variety is incredible. They have spacious seating in the back and are located in the downtown arts district."

This place was everything I wanted and more. The parking is a B*tch lol but that is the only problem. Once we found parking, the line was out the door and down the way. That is a great sign for a goOd time. I thought this was going to be a horrible wait. Turned out, the line moved pretty quickly and the employees made the line experience easy. First, while outside, a employee walked out and gave out menus to everyone & even offered personal favorites on beer, food, etc. Once we got to the door, they took our drink orders and offered to give it to us while we wait or when we finish the order. I thought that was awesome! Of course I took my drink in line because why not lol.Here is what you guys want to know; the food: well one sec! Let me tell you about the restaurant. The restaurant is a upscale Gastropub with a bar in the seating area. They have 4 huge family style bench tables and personal tables on a step up platform. They also have about 20-25 outdoor seating. We sat down and put our numbers out for the waiters to see and enjoyed our beers and the loud, fun atmosphere. O yeah, the food! So I was able to taste multiple hot dogs & sausages and they all had a unique taste that entertained your tastebuds. I enjoyed all of them. The fries are thick cut and come with a choice of two sauces. I mean I can go on forever on this place! We all left this place full, tipsy, and happy. All I wanted for my birthday was great food,  drinks, and my friends. This place earned the 5 stars on food quality & taste, amazing service, and creating the perfect atmosphere in my opinion. MUST COME BACK. You must try this out if you around here or are looking for a place to bust a mission to :D"

Get the buffalo ranch or the tzatziki if you're feeling light. They have a variety of mustards at each table too. My personal favorite was the whole grain mustard.

Little did I know what I was in for.The order taker implored that I try the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers Sausage and of course I opted in for the Belgian Fries. Within ten minutes my meal arrived and I knew it was something special just by the sight of things. Rattlesnake & Rabbit; I know exactly what you are thinking. You are wrong. It is glorious. The snap of the casing yields way to possibly the most delicate meat I have ever tried in incased meat format and the bold, savory spices completely are complimented by the fiery finish thanks to the Jalapeños. The bun was a bit too large but that was easily fixed by tearing off the surplus and next time around I may even forgo the bun as it is just filler once the Sausage hits the palette. Wurstküche makes one damn fine Sausage. The Fries were quite good as well, certainly a 4 star even in their own right, but I will opt for overcooked next time to get a better exterior. Paired with Mustard, the perfect compliment to the Sausage.They offer numerous Craft Beers I could not partake in thanks to it being a business power lunch, but my return is most certain. Wurstküche is the realness."

Just people trying to enjoy some hot dogs and beer!Tons of great sausages to choose from, at an affordable price too.

I was a bit overwhelmed when it came to ordering because there were so many odd combinations! rabbit, rattlesnake, etc. I mean... that's pretty random and exotic to me. but, no sorry I don't have the guts to actually try it haha. you're able to pick two toppings with your hot dog, which include: sour kraut, caramelized onions, sweet peppers, or spicy peppers. I went with the jalapeño mango hot dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. one hot dog looked quite large to me, so I stuck with one. my boyfriend went with the exotic ones, I forgot but he said that one was better than the other. but they were both good and exotic. so I guess it wouldn't necessarily hurt to try it. then we ordered a large order of fries! ohhhh my goodness. something about their French fries are quite addicting! they're huge, and the texture is perfect. with the large order of fries, you have the option of two dipping sauces. GET the CHIPOTLE AOILI!! so good and won't disappoint. we also got the curry ketchup, which was okay to me. they also have drinks that are quite different from other places. I noticed cucumber soda, ginger beer, etc. I tried the ginger beer and it didn't even taste like beer, it was more like soda with ginger flavoring. I'm not a fan of ginger at all, I thought it was ok. I personally wouldn't order it myself. overall, really good place! but I'd only go if my friends want it. I wouldn't gear towards something like this."

We thought it was a secret entrance or something! But we really liked the decor of the whole place. They're known for their \"exotic\" hot dogs, so I tried the Pheasant and my boyfriend got the buffalo. Both were really good! At each table, they have a bunch of different mustards so I thought that was pretty neat. It was a little expensive for the \"exotics\", so I might opt for the classics next time."

        "review": "I'm sorry Wurstkuche, we just didn't hit it off): Located in the arts district of downtown LA, it is a trendy location for those looking for exotic hotdogs! Since I do not consume red meat, I was excited to see other meat and vegetarian options, including a chicken apple sausage. However, they ran out of the it so I settled for the Italian vegetarian sausage with the Belgian fries. The Italian tasted a bit funky and off to me, but it's probably because it was vegetarian. I did expect something more from this purveyor of sausages though.Since I prefer fries of the shoestring, skinny variety, the Belgian fries were also a miss for me): They are cut into thick slices, and the condiments were eh too. Give me plain ol' ketchup instead any day! I really tried to love this place, but it just didn't deliver for me): I would love to come back and try some of their other sausages though!"

I came here with my photography class while we were in the area and we definitely had to try this place.The menu itself was pretty straightforward. Ranges from vegan/vegetarian to exotic sausages. I heard the menu changes from time to time, so I might have to come back.There's indoor and outdoor seating down the hall from the ordering area. The indoor seating consisted of long communal style seating in the center of the room and a few smaller tables scattered about. There's a bar area too if you're in need of a refill.I would suggest getting whatever the most exotic sausage there is at the time of your visit because, let's be honest here, you might as well.It'll cost you around $10-11 for the hot dog and an order of fries."

        "review": "So I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't packed at all like the last times I had been here. Other times I've been here during the evenings and the lines were out the door, but not this time it was a nice change for once. I tend to be a creature of habit and always order the same thing. I got the mango jalepeño which is a turkey and chicken sausage. With any dog you order you get to choose two toppings. I ordered the caramelized onions and the sweet peppers. There are a total of 4 toppings you can choose. the other two ate spicy peppers or sauerkraut. My toppings added a nice crunch. The peppers had grilled marks. That was so delicious. Like that smokiness taste. I love my veggies grilled. 5/5I also tried the filipino Maharlika, which is a sweet pork sausage. Totally tasted like longuinesa (which is a filipino sausage). This was very juicy. 4/5The other sausage I tried was the rabbit veal and pork seasoned with white wine sauce. This was amaze balls. Definitely a must try, but my fave will always be the mango jalepeño one. The flavors are just so outstanding in this one. 5/5I also ordered the Klein fries, which are like steak fries . The cut is very thick. Seasoned very well and was crunchy and hot. fries are very well made. love me my potatoes!!! With the fries you get to choose one dipping sauce. I chose the curry ketchup which had a nice spice and kick to it. The are a bunch of other dipping sauces such as chipotle aoli, buttermilk ranch, chipotle ketchup, pesto mayo, sweet & sassy bbq, Thai peanut, blue cheese walnut & bacon, sundried tomato mayo, and the tzatziki sauce. Any Additional dipping sauces are 0.75 cents extra. 5/5For my beverages I got Mr. Q cucumber drink. If you guys have never tried this its so refreshing and light. It's like a carbonated drink with a hint if cucumber. Not too sweet at all. I love it. 5/5And got a shantelle beer(sorry totally forgot the name). Very similar to a hefeweizen. This bebr was pretty darn good. Went great with the sausages. 5/5So once you order your meal at the front and pay for it they hand you a number. Grab a seat inside or if you prefer outside seating they have that as well. And the come and bring your order to you. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. Always a wonderful experience here with delicious food and great ambiance. Nice change to come for once when it's not so packed and crowded."

There's no minimum for ordering to-go, but once you order greater than 12 sausages, they'll put a cap on the variety you can order (no more than 3 types for that order). Once you place your order, they'll give you an estimated time of when your order will be ready. Mine was 15-20 minutes (surprised? I sure was). Go to the back bar when you arrive, pick up your order, pay for it, and off you go! Relatively painless process, even though it was barely past peak lunch hours.Many thanks to the staff at Wurstkuche for the awesome service! Will definitely be back! :)Note:* The darjeeling tea is sold by the bottle (hence the heft $4.50 price tag). I made the mistake of order 5 for 5 people because I thought they were individual servings. Whoops!"

Arts District and decided to start exploring starting with Wurstküche.  Our maiden voyage went well with us standing in line to get in to order. Once we were in the property line a sweet lady asked us if we would like a beer to start off.  I didn't know what I wanted and after a few probing questions she handed me a Duchess en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du… .  This was now MY beer.  Hubby ordered a Belgium beer as well and was pleased.  This was all about me as I am not normally a beer drinker but this Lambic style beer was Heaven in a glass! When it came time for us to order, we decided on Pheasant with Herbs de Provence and Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers.  You can pick two toppings:Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers, and Spicy Peppers. Gourmet mustards - self serve in the back Whole Grain Dijon, Spicy Brown, Honey Mustard, American Yellow and KetchupWe took our beers to the dining area and was greeted with wood beam ceiling, brick walls, european type seating, some round tables with a benches and a few semi private tables in a room that can be closed off. Both were juicy and delicious.  With the Spicy Brown mustard we slathered on the sausage it was hard to tell what we were consuming.  The fries are extremely good with a nice crunch.  We have been back 5 or 6 times now and when we have Hoshi we sit out on the patio and simply enjoy the DTLA view and relax. Parking can be a bear.  Limited and expensive in the evening.   Here's a little secret, if you just want to come in and order beers, you don't have to wait in line at the front entrance, you can come through the side entrance, order your beers and sit at the bar or any available seating.  Sausages - 5 StarsSelection of beers - 5 StarsBartender - 5 Stars - knowledgeable and asks probing questions to meet your beer needs. Fries - 5 Stars Decor - 5 Stars - great marriage of concrete, brick and wood.  If this place is indicative of the feel of The Arts District, I look forward to exploring some more!"

All the sausages are unique so I suggest going easier on the condiments to fully embrace the flavor. I highly recommend the hot Italian sausage for that extra level of spiciness. It can also get really crowded on weekend evenings so plan ahead! I visit once ever few months and the beer selection is always the same. Luckily they have a pretty diverse selection of craft beers on tap. If you don't know what pairs well with the particular sausage you are ordering, feel free to ask! They'll be more than happy to help you.Tip: there's free street parking a few blocks south, however it will require a bit of walking"

I don't know if it's really that German-style but there is a huge selection of sausages that range from \"normal\" to eclectic choices, as well as veggie and vegan choices for some of you. The meat is very, very succulent. Also, you can get an assortment of toppings (sauerkraut, yay!) and ridiculously good sauces if you get fries. Go for the truffle fries - yum! My favorite was the creamy bacon dip (bleu cheese walnut and bacon). The atmosphere is definitely hip - it's wedged into the Art District of DTLA so go figure. I like that the ordering sections separated from the dining area, which is in the back after a very cool and dark hallway. Parking can be a hassle if it's a busy day, but generally you can find street parking. It's DTLA after all. The only con of this place is that sometimes the line wraps outside of the down and down the block."

This is the perfect place to go if you're visiting town, hosting friends, or if you and a big group of friends want to go somewhere to relax. It can get especially packed during dinner time, and I've seen a long line out of the door several times starting at 10 or 11 pm. But with the way it's set up with lining up to order and then finding a table, the flow usually works so that you can find a table. I typically don't have any issue getting a table with friends and I've gone at busy and slow times.Now... as for the food! YUM!!!!!! All of the exotic 'brats are great! I've tried a few of them but I'm pretty settled on the 'Rattlesnack & Rabbit' because it has just the right amount of spice for me! A close second is the 'Mango Jalapeno' again because of a perfect amount of spice, but also with the mango twist. I HIGHLY encourage you to get a side of truffle fries to go with whichever 'brat you pick! PLEASE DO! Even if you're not that hungry, split it with a friend or two. The fries are some of the best I've ever had! I'm a chipotle lover so I also accompany the fries with Chipotle Aioli or Chipotle Ketchup (or both).I usually don't go for the beers because my favorite place to drink (Angel City Brewery) is right down the street. That said I've had a few of their beers and I'd recommend the Chimay White."

We washed them down with some sarsaparilla. Surprisingly to my tastebuds, there was little to no aftertaste.  The rattlesnake had a nice amount of heat to it from the jalapenos, and the addition of rabbit gave it a nice balance.We ate up at the front in the cash register area as the music in the main area was too loud for us (it was almost midnight) to have a conversation."

Two of us shared two hotdogs: (1) a mango jalapeño dog with caramelized onions and sweet peppers, and (2) a sun-dried tomato and mozzarella dog with sauerkraut and sweet peppers.  Both had a chicken and turkey base, and both were easily the most delicious hotdogs I've ever come across.  We also shared a large (\"groot\") side of Belgian-style hand-cut fries, which were cooked to a perfect crisp.  Even better were the dipping sauces -- we had the tzatziki as well as the bleu cheese walnut and bacon.  (If you've never tried dipping your fries in tzatziki -- do it!  You can thank me later.)  There's also abundant bottles of free mustards and ketchup on all the tables.  Wurstküche is hotdog heaven.  Trust me -- one bite and you'll be smitten, just like I was."

This is a smaller space, though, and because of the location, it gets paaaaaacked, especially on weekends. The tables get a little... um.. icky as the night goes on."

I'm always thinking I'll try something else and end up getting the Sun Dried Tomato/Mozzarella Sausage with fries.  They have the thick belgian fries with a great assortment of sauces. (Again, I\"m a total sauce freak!)Heads up, parking can be a little difficult.  You'll have to find meter parking or you can go to Little Tokyo Shopping Plaza (Alameda/3rd) and use their parking structure for a fee.  If you're going to go in for dessert, most of the places inside validate."

You order in the front and then head to a big dining area in the back. The tables were long and clean. There was a bar in the back and even a DJ set. I'm guessing this place is popping at night.

Line was a little slow, but I definitely didn't help that myself so I cannot complain (just noting it!). Seating was plentiful and our food came pretty quickly. I ordered a brat with sweet peppers and a large fry with chipotle aioli. The fries are Belgian style, and were delicious though some were a bit too crisp or burnt. The brat was cooked just right and delicious. The bun it was sitting in was one of the best rolls I've ever had in a restaurant, period (bun may have overshadowed the brat, to be honest). I had a cream soda with my meal and I think it worked well with the everything I ate, but I wish they were slightly cheaper :( The selection is awesome and I'm very much looking forward to returning to try more sausages :) I think I will get something with buffalo, next time.Another note on food/drink selection: I don't drink, but the people I ate with enjoyed the German beers they ordered...take that as you will. I only wish it was slightly cheaper because I definitely should've gotten two or three sausages, but I didn't want to ruin my tiny budget for eating out ($6 for basic sausages to $8 for the fancier ones) :( Looking forward to a return trip the next time the guys are in town!"

You have to walk up to the bar and order food and drinks. Oh wait though, where's the menu? Not at the table, the bar has those too and they keep them stashed in a drawer. Okay??? What am i supposed to order if you keep the menu's hidden and nobody is serving us? So finally we get the menu and its lacking so many German food items. Then we start laughing about this ridiculous experience. Place is completely bland. Hardly feels German and nobody helps you.

Mark up front (awesome guy with the \"kid-n-play\" flattop fade) was pleasantly exuberant and had an extensive comprehension of the delicious different beers on tap, and helped me pick the absolute perfect beer to go with my food. In the dining room, Kat brought out our food and gave us exemplary service during the whole time we were dining with a sincere smile, making us all feel like old friends.

They were out of the beer I originally tried to order and the bartender was kind enough to let me sample other types based on what I was looking for.

Zwick'l is the last one on the German beer list and that one comes in a tall ceramic mug.

If so, you should visit Wurstkuche (\"kuche\" means \"kitchen\" in German) in the Arts District of Downtown LA.You can opt to pay for parking across the street, or try your luck in finding street parking. Once you've passed that first hurdle, there's usually a nice long line here during lunch and dinner. During this time, you'll want to start making up your mind as to which sausage and beer you'd like to have.They have a variety of meats (the pictures do more justice than me describing it), but things like rabbit and rattlesnake are common. There's also different sausages fused or injected with different spices or sauces like the duck bacon jalapeno sausage (which I had during my visit here. Highly recommended). I also ordered a side of the Belgian fries, but found it was only okay. You'll definitely want to save more room for the sausages more than the fries.Knowing that their patrons are probably getting thirsty standing in line, the staff usually tries to get your drink order well ahead of you making your food order. I had a Blanche de Bruxelles beer to go along with my two wursts in my last visit and just about finished it by the time I paid for my order.Once determining and paying for your items, you're given a table number and you proceed to the dining room or patio. There, you can order more beer and find a seat to enjoy the food. There are water stations in the rear for those avoiding beer or trying to be a good designated driver for the group.The interior reminds me more of a typical German Oktoberfest set up, complete with long wooden benches and shared tables. Even if you come by yourself (and there is nothing wrong with that!), you can definitely find something to talk about with your neighbors regarding the exotic food. As you know, there's no better conversation starter than \"Is that rattlesnake?\""

Head down the skinny hallway and take a seat in the most hipster cafeteria setting ever. I dig it. OH, try to snag a table where all the mustard is located. The whole grain & honey are on point!"

I doused every bite with thick grainy mustard and savored the deliciousness.  The fries were good but not great; they were thicker crunchy fries, double-fried as I understand it and I did not see nor taste any truffle oil. I would skip this next time in lieu of sharing another sausage. So for amazing sausages in a trendy/cool location with a cool vibe, Yay! I'm a fan!"

Pro- tip: But the line for the ordering area is on Traction.If you come in the wrong door later in the day, the eating area is very dimly lit.Again, is that part of the charm?The aisle are not very wide table length-wise.  Only one person can walk comfortably.Hard to tell who works there or not.  But after seeing a guy bus a table, I ask him where do I go to order food, based on reading the reviews.He tells me to go down the hallway to the counter.I make my way to the counter.  Yes, it is well lit.  Hmmm.The line snakes along the triangular spaced entrance and out into the nighttime cold.  They have staff working the line.They herd us like cattle with these commands:Stand along the wall.  Move over.  Squeeze together.  Would you like a drink?Our credit card machine is working slowly.  We are out of Hot Italian and Louisiana Hot Link ( I think).I am not sure how to interpret slowly working.  Is it sick?  Still recovering from NYE?  They of course accept cash.  Cash is king.  Or so they say.  Idioms. They were offering samples of the Austin Blues to compensate for our extra long wait time and for the slowly working credit card machine.After 15-20 mins, we finally reach the front of the line.We order two dogs, Austin Blues with onions and sweet peppers.I wanted the Hot Italian but had to settle with Brockworst.  Based on the counter, they had tons of sausages. Is Hot Italian that popular?We grab a table.  My guest did not want to partake in the communal table space.We sit in the dark waiting/hoping that the server can see our number.Finally, someone brings our food.  Yeah.Here is my pic of my hot dog: yelp.com/biz_photos/wurs…I grab some of the fries.  Hoping to enjoy the Bleu Cheese Walnut & Baconthat everyone seems to rave about.  Yuck my fries are semi-warm.I spend some time trying to locate someone to flag down.After a bit, I decide to walk back to the counter.As I approach, I ask a guy if he works here.  Yes, he replies.I mention that my fries were luke-warm.  Nothing.  Just a blank stare.Hmmm.  Now annoyed, I ask for 2 to-go containers.He grabs some stuff, turns around, and hands it to me.I walk down that long dark hallway back to the dining area.I am thinking what a waste.  Where is the customer service?I noticed on how they had fries just sitting next to the fryer.  No wonder they were luke-warm.  I guess that they can mess up a simple thing like fries.They could have easily replaced my fries and made me a happy camper.Mess with my starch?  My fries?  Honestly, that was my main reason for coming.I wanted to taste their Belgium fries with their sauces.  But alas, this was not meant to be.Maybe I should have gone to their Venice location.Maybe they were so focused on their credit card machine not working.Tainted view of this place?  Maybe. Slightly.  Okay, yes.This review was written when I got back.  So definitely.Overall, hard to locate.  They blew simple customer service 101.I would not recommend this place due to the bitter taste of lack of service.Will my review affect their business, probably not.Will it affect me spending anymore money at this place, yes.I am tossing and turning in my bed as I lust for fries."

You order up in the front and then head down the alley into the back area where there's picnic tables all around and beer on tap too! It gets pretty loud in here, but that's what you expect for a spot serving nothing but beer and bratwurst. They have very exotic and interesting types of hot dogs, so be adventurous. I usually order the mango jalepeno ($8) with grilled onions and spicy peppers. You also can choose from sweet peppers and sauerkraut as your toppings. My friend and I also shared a large order of the fries ($5). These fries are a must as they're a thick and crispy cut. It comes with a choice of dipping (one for small; two for large). We got the chipotle aioli and buttermilk ranch. I like the taste of each, but you also have a variety of mustards and ketchup on the tables for free. Their honey mustard is also very good with the fries and hotdogs, so try a little bit of everything for your fitting."

My personal favorites are the Louisiana Hot Link and Hot Italian. They have just the right amount of spice while retaining the juicy flavor. Add some of their tasty Belgian fries along with a cold one and you're good to go.Another major plus is that Wurstkuche's sausages don't leave you feeling too heavy afterwards. I wish their sausages were just a tad bigger and a little more loaded on the toppings such as peppers and onions, but that's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things.I suggest going on a sunny weekend afternoon as it's not too crowded and you can enjoy the patio."

It's like walking into a rooftop lounge or busy college pub with lots of conversations, DJ playing good music, and top notch German sausages with imported beers. The unique thing here is that you can order and sip a beer while standing in line! Thats legit. I had a German IPA that was fresh and bitter tasting but was enough to get me on. Pretty expensive for $8 a glass though but once again, they are imports. I ordered the rabbit-rattlesnake sausage which was gamey, tasted like chicken, and had this roasted peppery taste. This was one of the most exotic things I've ever tried and what better way to have it in a hot dog form. This is a great place for friends and family; a group. The experience is great! You can mingle and meet new people around you. I recommend coming here around midnight or close to that time because it's live and people come to drink and have fun.I'll def be coming back for more! I'll always have to make a pit-stop here for sure at late nights during my stays in LA."

After perusing the menu, my friend and I decided on the mango jalapeño hot dog with caramelized onions and spicy peppers and the Louisiana hot link with caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I preferred the mango jalapeño because it was sweet, but not too sweet, with some heat. The Louisiana hot link was okay but I didn't really think it had a flavor. It just tastes hot. The sweet/spicy peppers are also not particularly sweet/spicy. The sweet peppers are just a combination of sautéed yellow and red bell peppers and the spicy are just sautéed green bell peppers. The fries are also BOMB. They're double fried like Korean fried chicken so they're uber crispy on the outside and super fluffy, almost creamy, on the inside. Paired with the Chipotle Ketchup, they were oh so satisfying. I definitely want to come back to eat fries and try all the different sauces.The reason why Wurstküche isn't getting 5 stars for me are two reasons:01. the beer02. the atmosphereThey have a wide selection of great sounding beers. My friend and I ordered an Apple Ale because I thought it just sounded refreshing against the greasiness of the hot dog. Isn't that good, Justin? Why yes it is random stranger reading my review. They are good but there is just so much foam on top. My ale was poured into a pilsner glass so pouring it with minimal foam should be pretty easy but a good inch or two was just foam. Whoever's pouring these has got to take some lessons or visit a college party or something. I saw other people ordering beers in line and it was pretty severe for everyone's. I felt bad for this one dude whose beer came in a goblet. Literally half was just foam. He finished it before it was his turn to order and he bought another one. I guess the atmosphere could be a pro or con depending on how you looked at it. It was LOUD. There was a DJ and progressively, it seemed as if the music was just getting louder and louder. My friend and I were already yelling at each other just to hear and mid-meal we just gave up and ate in music-raped silence. It was just kind of odd because the decor was very urban chic with lots of wood and metal so the club music just seemed out of place. Literally, all they need are lights and you've got a nightclub.Also, if you end up sitting at the communal rows of picnic benches, grabbing sauces is kind of awkward because there's only a few of each for a bunch of parties you most likely don't know. However, the hot dog was definitely juicy and flavorful enough that the mustards and ketchup take away more than they add. The bench seating kind of makes it harder for larger groups to find seating though."

He said that a lot of the beer that they serve here you can't even buy in the US. I tried an apple and strawberry beer, both which tasted kind of like juice, which was a major win for me since I'm not a big beer drinker. What gets expensive here is not the food but all of the beer that you have to go along with it.  Seriously, why are people complaining that a $6 to $8 sausage is too expensive if it's your DINNER?  We spent maybe $25 on food here for two people (cheap for dinner!) but about $50 on beer (not so cheap but totally in our control).Not an every day, or every month kind of place... but definitely a \"I'm in the mood for some gluttony\" kind of place."

This was my second time at Wurstkuche however my first time at this particular location. Gets crowded on a Saturday night so get in line early before it keeps piling on! Be aware that they do not condone cutters at all so don't cut in line! Besides, the line moves along fairly fast :P I ordered the buffalo, beef, & pork with chipotle peppers (we got this recommendation from a staff member who said it was his favorite). I added on my personal favorite toppings: caramelized onions and spicy peppers which you're allowed to pick from a list. The meat was very delicious and bursting with flavor. You can also add/try 6 different sauces which are available in bottles kind of scatter around the tables. We were lucky to sit next to a table with guys that was just there for drinking so they said we could have their bottles. We also got the groot fries which were really delicious and extra crispy. Don't be afraid to try them out with the different sauces as well! The building is very oddly shaped. As soon as you order, you walk down this narrow path which leads you to a bigger room where people eat. Btw, they give you a number after you order and the staff will bring out your order to you as soon as they're ready. There was a DJ and loud music was being played on top of people talking to each other. It just was a bit much for me. Luckily there's outside seating where it was much quieter however the tables are also oddly shaped and small so it wasn't ideal for big groups at all as it could get very cramped if you have a lot of orders sitting on the table. Overall I would come back just because I love the area and you could seriously hit all the establishments when you're there (dessert, beer, bar, etc). That's a whole itinerary just for one area so capitalize on that!Note: Parking can be hell. There's street parking only or those private lots where you can pay $10 for instance for the whole night. It's definitely not worth it to me to circle around that much. But read the signs carefully because some will say $5 and in really itty bitty writing, it'll say each 15 minutes. LIKE WHAAAT..."

They even threw in the statement that there were over 6,000 good Yelp reviews. It was very close so how could I pass it up?  I ordered the Hot Italian with grilled onions and bell peppers. In addition, I picked up a side of fries. Basically the hotdog or sausage dog was really good! The casing was nice and crispy. It had a crunch in every bite. The bell peppers and onions complimented the hotdog well. The fries are pretty killer too. The fries are different. I'm not sure how to describe them, but it's something worth trying out. The bottom line is this place is a winner! It is a little on the pricey side if you're a struggling artist or student.  For a sausage dog, fries, and a drink you'd be looking at spending about $13.

Of course we liked them and if you choose your toppings wisely you can have some very wild or complementary flavors.  For example, sauerkraut and brautwurst - how can you even go wrong?  But sauerkraut on a sweet sausage prob won't go well IMO.  The fries were not greasy at all which was surprising as they were super crispy yet soft in the middle.  Pluses for having Greek yogurt sauce.  I think with their bottled drinks like ginger ale or a craft beer, this meal can get pricey.  Keep in mind they have water in the back of the dining room if you want to keep you bill down. We went early and didn't deal with crowds, but when you get here late I assume their communal tables get packed and there is a lot of passing around of the mustard containers that are on the tables.The service in this place is one of the friendliest and everyone from the girl at the register to the table bussers were all very nice and helpful!  I think that their staff is a large part of why Wurstkuche is so well-liked and popular in LA.  Great food find!"

It tastes yummy and sounds far healthier than the other wide array if options! Street parking available. The servers were excellent. After enjoying a flavorful, full bodied Chimay, I was somewhat dissatisfied with the next less flavorful lager beer from the tap, so the barman replaced it without hesitation with another Chimay!  This was excellent customer service, and it will keep me coming back for more!"

I definitely see this more as a place to go in the afternoon to chill with friends over beers and sausages than a night venue."

Trust me, I know :p We were also skeptical after we asked an employee who claimed it was pronounced \"worst-kuka.\" Uhmm..? Lol. I've only been here a couple of times, but I love everything about it- the food, the beers, location, ambiance, etc. There is a huge selection of sausages to choose from, so if you wanna pass on the gourmet selections they also have some classic choices too. I've tried the Rattlesnake + Rabbit, the Gator + Pork, and the Duck + Bacon-- all were very tasty and delicious. The only thing about the Gator + Pork, for me, was that the casing was a little too thick. Regardless, I'd order it again, because it also has some spice. Don't forget to try the Truffle Fries & all the sauces you can. We had the Garlic Aioli and Pesto Mayo and (of course) loved both. I've only tried a few selections of beers, but my favorite so far is the Chimay White. For all the non-beer drinkers, I'd suggest trying the Früli (strawberry beer that tastes almost like a wine cooler). The dining/bar area has an awesome social vibe, which makes the experience here that much better. It's a great place to go to start your night out with a group of friends."

        "review": "I love this place! It has a very modern take on German beer house. You walk in and order your food and walk around the back and you find a seat on benches like those you would find at a beerfest you'll probably be sharing with complete strangers (they're strangers at first, but they'll probably become friends through the night). There's a bar area too where you can order many craft beers. I've tried the duck, bacon with jalapeños sausage and the mango jalapeño sausage. Both were very delicious and flavorful, my only complaint is that the roll that it is served on is a little overbearing for the sausage. I always get the sweet peppers and caramelized onions to top the sausage. The fries are pretty good too, they are steak fries, and I usually prefer shoestring, but the fries serve as a great vessel for the array of sauces you can choose from. My favorite sauce was the chipotle aioli. I've also tried the pesto mayo, curry ketchup, and the tzatziki sauce. My least favorite was tzatziki because it was too mild for the fries. I tried many beers one night I was here, but I remember my favorite was the Pauwel Kwak. It's served in a glass with a wooden handle.This place is very fun and a very great start for your night! I can't wait to come back to try the different sausages and beers!"

There was a line outside the building, but the host brought menus so you can decide what you wanted before you made it to the register. Also, the bar inside had no line so I had my girlfriend but me a chamay white $8 for .25L to enjoy while in line. If you don't come with someone else, the host will ask you if you want to order a beer once the line makes itself inside the building.After a quick 20 minute wait we split a large fries with chipotle aioli and house buttermilk ranch and a bockwurst with sauerkraut and carmalized onions. Everything came out to perfection. At the table you have a choice of a plethora of mustards. I enjoyed a liter of German Franziskaner heffe weizen. The beer came frosty from the tap and was unbelievably crisp and delicious. The beer me back another $12 and tip. Also, if you order a liter they take your credit card hostage until you return the mug. This was one of our favorite stops in LA and we hope to visit again soon."

And yes, Westvleteran 12, the world's best - according to many - and rarest beer is here, and priced accordingly... For those with shallower pockets, try Le Trou du Diable Dubaii Pilée - a memorable double IPA for me! Sausages and beer - comfort food done right!

Also, local loft owners and arts district peeps that live around there. Some other shops and places to see around there. No TV's here at the large bar.

Finally, I got it right before we made our order. I was very  impressed with the interior. Dim light, music and \"mind your own sausage\" crowd made it more exciting.Who eats rattlesnake, rabbit and alligator? I don't. It has to be in the form of sausages! We chose from GOURMET, CLASSIC OR EXOTIC. If you choose to be boring, then pick your sausage from gourmet or classic. The RATTLE SNAKE AND RABBIT was really juicy and full of flavor. I don't know how a rattlesnake tastes like nor a rabbit, but I know this one was genuine. The DUCK and BACON was nothing special. The FILIPINO MAHARLIKA is like my own sweet pork longganisa but it was really super tasty. Paired with  fries and beers, AYINGER CELEBRATOR and 1809 BERLINER WEISSE, the whole experience was worth the try. I will be back for more,fosure!"

It was a nice day and the windows were open, allowing a pleasant breeze into the space.A second bar is available in the back if you want another drink and don't want to go wait in line at the front, which can get busy with food orders.My only regret?

It is an issue in every gentrified neighborhood in town.When you first get there, you stand in line to order. There are many different types of homemade sausages for you to choose from and all of the different toppings are available upon request. The beers are European and all have their own signature glasses.The sodas are artisanal and eclectic choices. I actually ordered a soda because I was the driver and was not disappointed by the two choices I made. I did get the try the beer though, and I was sad that I couldn't partake.The dining experience is interesting and cool. You order your food and then go back to a dining area where you sit at picnic tables with many different people. It was perfect for us because we had a large group and this style of seat was very accommodating. They will bring the food to you and the condiments are located either edge of the table where you may have to ask a stranger to pass one of the myriad mustards available. I ordered the kielbasa with ground mustard and sauerkraut. It was so juicy and flavorful that you could tell this was not processed. The roll was soft with a nice crust so that the juices didn't make the sandwich fall apart. The sauerkraut  had lots of flavor but was not overly sour to drowned out the flavor of the sausage. The order of fries were really good, especially with the dipping sauces that we ordered. I ordered one of the flavored ketchups and the basil mayo. I don't know how I lived without having flavored condiments before or since.I can't wait to go back and try the different sausages offered by this place. The bratwurst and the Italian sausages looked  crafted with care and pride. I'm sure I'll be dreaming of the day I get to pass through the doors again."

As you enter, you will find the cashier. You order your food and initial drinks at the cashier. If you notice on other people's pictures on Yelp, there's a glass case that displays the sausages, uncooked, they have for your reference. I appreciate this. I've tried several sausages: Bratwurst, Chicken Apple & Spices, and Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Spices. My favorite has to be the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno Spices. The texture is firm and the flavor has a kick.After you order, you go down a really dark hallway into the eating area. The eating area has plenty of picnic tables, is spacious, and has a bar. You can order more of your drinks there. There's also outdoor seating. Experiment with the beer menu. I can't recommend one because I can never pronounce any of the names, but I've never been disappointed. The employees are very friendly, so ask for recommendations. This place is family-friendly.

Perfectly salted fries so fluffy they rival In-N-Out. Ceaselessly smiling servers toting vintage sodas and world class beers. Welcome to Wurstküche. The restaurant itself is positively alive. Even at 11:30 am on a Friday, the mock-industrial space was packed to the brim with people of all ages: from toddlers chowing down on bratwurst on the sunny patio to hip 20-somethings in matching chambray. But on top of its unique menu and patrons, the culture behind the restaurant is interesting as well. I visited on a field trip with a entrepreneurship class; we were fortunate to meet founder and USC grad Tyler, and learn a little bit about its beginnings.

My favorite sauce to order with fries is chipotle aioli. It's really good, and even goes well with the sausages. The only downside to eating here is that finding parking can be annoying."

How to have the perfect Wurstkuche night of your lyfe: 1) Find parking along the streets, you may have to make a few circles around the block, or park a jillion steps away, or in some shady looking alley, or if all else fails, park in one of those expensive lot with misleading and false advertising signs...but don't worry, it'll all be worth it in the end (unless you really  went and parked in the expensive lot with misleading signs and advertisements... because those are always lame) 2) Get in line (often goes out the door...but it moves by super fast I promise) 3) Order the Mango Jalapeño ($7) - chicken and turkey with mango and jalapeños ... the perfect savory, sweet and spicy combination! 3) Order the Belgium fries! And try the Bleu Cheese and Bacon dip... or the Chipotle sauce, either combo will take you to french fry potato heaven... ($3.50 for small which is plenty enough) 3) Order a beer. Get a glass of your favorite, or try something new. Wurstkuche has an extensive selection of delish beers, you're sure to find your perfect drank. 4) Grab your number, find a seat and enjoy the music and crowd while you wait for your food. 5) Once your food arrives, take all necessary Instagram pics, selfies, etc then enjoy the yummiest hawt dawg of your life!"

        "review": "It has been a long while since I have been here, so I can't really recall which of the sausages I had tried in the past. At this visit, both myself and a friend decided to eat here after shopping a sample sale. When we walked in, there was a bit of a line, but one of the employees was super friendly and explained the menu to us and helped us to choose what we wanted. Both of us decided on the Duck & Bacon with Jalapeno sausage with Sauerkraut and caramelized onions on top. We also added a large order of fries and the Chipotle Aioli and Bleu Cheese, Walnut & Bacon dipping sauces. The total for one sausage and fries was almost $15.00.We were super excited when we received our food. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it was extremely overpriced for what it was. The Duck & Bacon had flavor, but we still needed to add Mustard and Ketchup to really give it that extra taste. I'm sure that the quality of the meats is what makes the price higher, but I really was expected to be blown away. Like I said, it was still good, just thought it could have been better.The fries on the other hand. OMMMGGGGG. Sooo delicious and they give you so many!!! The Chipotle Aioli dipping sauce was mouth watering and had just enough kick to it. The Bleu Cheese, Bacon & Walnuts was good as well, but I really was expecting more of a Bleu Cheese flavor. It was pretty mild, but the walnuts added a nice texture. I would come back here to eat fries only... Seriously...Overall, this is still a cool place to come and eat and hang out, but I wouldn't make it a frequent thing based on the price. The Service was great and I would absolutely still be interested in another visit to try another type of sausage.Side Notes: I am not a fan of beer, so I really can't say anything about their quality/selection. Depending on the day/time, parking around here really stinks."

After our first visit, we went again 6 days later for his birthday. Yes, he asked me to take him to a $40 meal for two for his birthday. I mean yes, I see the appeal- the curated list of German and Belgian beers (on tap!), the extensive hot dog choices from basic (brat) to healthy (spicy chicken and apples) to wordly (merguez; kielbasa; Italian), the generous portion of Belgian fries with a wide selection of aioli to chose from (the latter may be my favorite feature). Even the ketchup is delicious! And then there's the light wood interiors, the DJ spin table, the pleasant outside seating, the adorably down to earth hipster vibe of this downtown street corner. So why not that 5th star? The bread. It's dry, generally uninspired and bland. A fun place none the less."

I just started working downtown and while I cannot afford to eat out all the time, I do like an excuse to get out of the office and check out all that downtown has to offer. The food is great.  So far I have tried the jalapeno mango sausage and the hot Italian. They are delicious.With that said, I am not sure anything can beat the Belgian fries. I never had these before, so I was not sure what to expect, I do know that seeing them pass me by as servers were taking them to the customers, they looked delicious. I got the Klein-sized fries (which is pretty big) and a side of the chipotle aioli sauce. Holy $#!@ were these amazing. Completely elevated this place to an insane level of deliciousness. The seating is community style with long tables covered in brown paper, I find myself talking to others not only about this place but other eateries we all like to frequent. In fact I learned of other places that I had not heard of before. The portions are plenty. between the sausage and the fries along with a drink (several draft beers as well as old timey sodas in glass bottles) is sure to leave you more than full, but also planning your next trip back.

I came with a friend on a Sunday evening, only to be greeted by a monstrous line that went out the door, but it ended up moving pretty quickly so we only waited maybe 20 minutes or so. We decided to split the Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella and the Chicken Apple, just for some variety, as well as a large order of fries. Man, oh man, I was NOT disappointed! Of the two sausages, I think I liked the Sun Dried Tomato one better, just because it had more of a flavorful kick to it, whereas the Chicken Apple was a little more tame, but still very good. The fries though...THE FRIES. The girl who was directing the line recommended that we get the Chipotle Aioli and the BBQ and to double dip the sauces, and she definitely hit the nail on the head with that one. Even without the sauces, the fries were still deep, deep fried to perfection.The seating area has a really cool ambience to it. You can choose from smaller tables for more privacy, or longer picnic-style tables covered in paper and crayons if you're with a bigger group or just feel like reverting back to your childhood self! There's also a bar where you can order drinks and sit at for a more intimate setting. The place is dim and definitely very casual, making for a fun but low-key place to chill with some friends.I didn't try any of their beers this time...I know, I know, how could I?! But their extensive list of draft and bottled beers means there's something for everyone. I will DEFINITELY be back to try some of those, maybe accompanied by some more exotic links that I wasn't gutsy enough or emotionally prepared to try this time (rattlesnake and rabbit, anyone??)"

It looks closed off, but you go around the hallway to where seating is.  There's ample amount of seating space and ALL YOUR MUSTARD selections are on almost every table.  I really like how they have so many options for mustard. I think there were six different bottles. Anyway, it does take a while for food to arrive.  I ordered the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage (under the exotic meat section) with caramelized onions and spicy peppers.  The price for just this including tax is $8.72.  I think it's a bit overpriced for something so small, and it wasn't that filling either.  They have other things under the exotic meat section like duck and lamb (I personally don't consider those exotic though).  It was delicious, but I couldn't really tell if the rattlesnake/rabbit sausage really tasted any different than any other meat.  So, I wasn't too wow-ed.  Still pretty cool to say that I have eaten/tried rattlesnake/rabbit.  If you really wanted to eat rattlesnake or rabbit for what they really are and see how they really really really taste like, go to an Asian restaurant or something. Now I'm wondering if those restaurants exist in America. Overall, neat place and nice staff.  They have a nice selection of drinks and beers.  This place seems pretty cool to sit back and chill with a beer."

Arriving at the location was a little off put by the line out the door but I know that a good line means good food at the end. They were surprisingly quick getting through people and I appreciated they had someone go down the line to hand out menu. Also really nice that once you got into the lobby area the took your beer order to keep you happy during those final moments in line.I went for the chicken apple with spices topped with grilled onions and spice peppers. No meal is complete without a side order so I definitely added those belgian fries with pesto mayo and chipotle ketchup. Personally I didn't appreciate the limit of sauces and the fact that it was 75 cents for each extra tub.The seating area is really nice and the bring the food to you fairly quickly. Its still pretty self serve as the napkins and any utensils you may need are off to the side. They due have a bar out back as well if you are appetizing another beer. I went for the Houblon Chouffe which was quite floral but still very tasty.The ambience was very \"hipster\" and they were playing house music pretty loudly in the main eating area making it a little hard to have a regular conversation. Overall a good meal and I wouldn't mind coming back."

When I found out about Wurstkuche, I knew I had to try them out. I headed over with some folks for dinner one night to see how good their sausages really were.They have a pretty large variety of sausages and have them on display up front. Even though I knew I wanted exotic meats, I still had a hard time deciding. I finally went with Duck and Bacon with Jalapenos, Rattlesnake and Rabbit with Jalapenos, and Pheasant. All came served on a bun with peppers and onions. All 3 sausages were delicious, served fresh and piping hot, and each one had a unique flavor profile that tickled my taste buds. The Duck & Bacon was my favorite, but I could easily order any of them again, even though I would love to try some of the other flavors, too. We also ordered Belgian fries Groot (2 dipping sauces), and they were some of the best fries I have had in a while. The Blue Cheese Walnut and Bacon dipping sauce in particular is very tasty and is a sauce I definitely want to order again.The restaurant itself is very casual in the sense that you line up to order, take a number and find a table. The restaurant was quite crowded on a Wednesday evening, and the later it got the busier it became. They also have a very good draught beer list, primarily focusing on Belgian and German varieties. The prices seemed pretty reasonable, and the food was very good. If you like sausage, then you should check out Wurstkuche. You won't be disappointed."

You can order your sausage with or without a baked roll and add peppers and sweet onions. We each ordered vegetarian sausages, smoked apple sage and Mexican chipotle. We also ordered belgian fries. The smoked apple sage topped with peppers and sweet onions was savory. I would definitely try a meat option next time. Fries were good.

Basic bratty's for $6, premium for $7, and exotic for $8.I got the premium brat with caramelized onions and sauerkraut.  He got the rabbit and pork with sweet pepper and sauerkraut for $8.  We also got a side of their large fries for $6.  You can also order their raw links to go for 30% off.After you order and get your number, you walk to the back, past the restrooms, and you'll find a huge seating area, including a bar and patio outside for those who wish bring their dogs.  Every table has a set of condiments-- ketchup and different kinds of mustards.

Add Carmelized onions and grilled peppers. I also order the large fries with tahini and aioli. I also eat the fries with all the 6 different dipping sauces you can find laying out on the long benches or the tables. Dipping sauce galore! Fries are so good! Top it off with some craft beer and you are golden! Yummmm"

We weren't upset we thought maybe they were busy or down a employee. That being said the service was exceptional!! Pauline came by and asked us about our order before we even requested help. She went to check on it and found that it was a mistake with the order and ensured that it would be rushed. She was right! Not only that but the manager came and apologized and refunded us. Overall amazing food, great beer, and felt like a restaurant service with how welcoming and helpful everyone was but down to earth and good vibes. Thanks again!"

Your two seconds of a panic attack will immediately dissipate once you see a bunch of hipsters walking around. Street parking is abundant and cheap here. In fact, you should park here, go to Wurstkutche and then go to Little Tokyo. Don't bother parking in Little Tokyo. It's like two blocks away but parking prices are much more steep.When I first tried Wurstkuche, I thought to myself, \"This is how Brats Bros in Sherman Oaks should taste like!\" Yeah, I'm still bitter about that poor experience. Guy Fieri even vouched for Brat Bros. I learned to not follow him as much after that. I have to admit, the rattlesnake and rabbit was disappointing. It sounded really crazy but tasted like chicken and was kind of flavorless. However, the duck and bacon was more flavorful and juicy! I have also tried the mango and jalapeno and that has to be my favorite so far. Juicy and flavorful. I'd like it for to be spicier though. I have been wanting to try the alligator but they haven't had it in months. When I went again recently, it was completely off the menu! The truffle fries are okay. I'm not a fan of waffle fries but the chipotle aioli that I got with it complemented it well. Speaking of condiments, I like how a bunch of condiments are available on your table. They add slight subtleties to your sausages. The water taste a little funky here. There are cups for you to get it on your own. So skip the water and instead go for some beer or vintage soda. Overall, interesting and flavorful sausages. Wurstkuche is doing it right!"

Since we had a dinner later that evening, we ordered a small bit - Rattlesnake sausage and Belgian fries. OMG...Belgian fries were amazing! They were so crispy and warm - just perfect. We tried the chipotle and blue cheese walnut and bacon dipping sauces. We loved the chipotle sauce! However, the blue cheese sauce surprisingly lacked flavor.

The Belgian fries can use more crunch.  The curry ketchup just didn't go well with the fries.  It tasted like dry curry powder mix with ketchup.  I recommend trying a different sauce.It was difficult to discern the flavor between the two dogs.  I remember the toppings, but not so much the sausages.  Overall, I think this place is worth a second visit.  It just didn't quite fill the emptiness left by the closing of Hot Doug."

And it was wonderful that they allowed you to enjoy a beer while you waited! Plus this place has Chimay, which is my favorite, so A+ on their beer selection. I decided I wanted something unique - went with the lamb hot dog. The man at the register recommended I put sweet peppers on it - great recommendation. It was fairly easy to find seating for us (even at 7 pm). Food came out quickly and was hot and delicious. The tzatziki dip for the fries was fantastic! And so was the mustard selection!

We sat next to a male and female couple where the man was super gay and the nice wife seemed to not  be able to tell (maybe she likes it that was, not for me to judge) I also like that the name looks like it's called \"worst (area of a woman that rhymes with pootchie)\" Which if you ask me might be intentional.  When I think of a woman's no no place, the flavor of sourkraut and Dijon mustard sounds about right. Although since the main entree is weiners it would be better to maybe call it wurstkock (put an umlaut over something to make it more like a name for a piece of IKEA furniture.)They have a DJ and she loves it when people come up to her and ask her to play La Bamba.

From the expected to the unexpected. From the sausage you expect to try to the sausage that are so weird that you want to try. They have it all. Overall a unique place to try and try multiple times cause once Is just not enough. sausages are Served on fresh baked roll includes two toppings: carmaelized onions, sauerkraut, sweet peppers, spicy peppers. you could also order it without the roll as well. it's not cheaper but it'll allow you to try other sausages and not waste food. Ordered:*Duck and bacon with jalapeño peppers. $8 it had a little of an aftertaste to me and i love duck. couldn't finish this sausage. *Buffalo, beef, pork with chipotle peppers $8 personally i preferred this over the duck bacon. *Lamb with Mediterranean spices $8 if u like lamb I would recommend this. *Belgian fries- Groot size is mention for 2 ppl to share. $5.50 & you get two dipping sauces. the two dipping sauces i picked were Curry Ketchup & Chiptole aloei. my boyfriend liked the curry ketchup and i liked the chiptole aloei. bigger fries than what my boyfriend and i usually like to eat but it's worth a try. the following condiments are on the table: Honey mustard, Dijon, whole grain, American yellow, and ketchup.Tips:*Street parking or parking lot that u can pay for parking.  *Indoor and outdoor seating.  *Cash and credit card accepted. *They serve Alcohol.*across the street from the pie hole.*within a short walking distance to little Tokyo. *free water glasses.totally would recommend yelpers to try this joint out at least once."

Cucumber water?? Whatever it is, I enjoyed the glass while waiting for my food.  The take out didn't take long, about 10 minutes, and I asked for the condiments on the side.Even after eating our Brat and Bock 4 hours later, it was still very tasty. Yes, the bun was a bit chewy, but I knew it wasn't going to be orgasmic.  The Brat was better than the Bock, and I want to go back and try the FIlipino one next time, with the Belgium fries.  $6 for the sausage,  which seems pretty decent.  They aren't that big, so 1 didn't fill me up, but it also didn't leave me hungry."

They had free complimentary steins which I enjoyed then and still do til this day. A manager, or perhaps just a regular staff member, told us if we were going to order anything off the menu it'd need to be ordered in line from the opposite side. In my head I was thinking.. \"but I bought my beer already.\"So our group, steins in hand, go outside and get in line.. And that's when the fun begins. We got a bunch of \"Looky Lou's\" and a \"Debbie Downer\" literally walked right up to us. \"Can you drink beers OUTSIDE of Wurstkuche??!\" a lady asked us confidently. \"I'm not sure, but we're currently doing so\" I replied.*Lady walks in and walks back out with staff member.\"Can they drink these beers outside? I swear there's a sign that says you can't!\" The lady asks the staff member who she went out of her way to grab.\"Umm.. not that I'm aware of. You guys just need to keep those low so we don't get in trouble..\" the staff member politely shrugs us off. \"Ugh, that's not fair\" Lady grunts. \"Here, we'll make this easier and less uncomfortable for you\" I said to this lady. I looked at my friends and we all knew it was time to chug. My friend who doesn't drink at all started the chug chant, and low and behold a few USC students got a kick out of it and joined in the chug festivities. She hated every second of this and basically got quiet and embarrassed. People, mind your business. That's all I have to say about that.. other than I hope to run into her again and brighten her dark day.We finally stepped up to order.. With so much to choose from, making a decision became a daunting task... However, listening to everyone before us ordering I got the vibe on what was popular and what wasn't. They've got your everyday bratwursts to the 'exotic' menu which consists of alligator, rabbit, buffalo and more!I grabbed the Duck & Bacon w/ Jalapeno Pepper Exotic Sausage and Rattlesnack / Jack Rabbit. Maybe my palate was off this day, but both tasted similar.. although the Duck and the Bacon was a little sweeter and tender, while the rattlesnake / rabbit was a little tough and saltier.. Neither was bad, and they were equally mouth wateringly good. I'll need to cone back and try a few more cause these things are packed with flavor! Both were tremendous combined with the multiple brews ordered on tap! You're given a number and are prompted to head back to the seating hall where your food will later be delivered to your seat. The seating is somewhat \"Medieval\".. as in you're sat on long, wooden, festival like tables that seat probably 20-25 on each. No space in between, so be prepared to rub elbows with people you may or may not know! There's a little outside patio too that is nice to sit on due to the fact that you're DTLA and in the arts district.. so vibrant colors and 'hip' people are everywhere!A little crowded for my blood, but with a group of beer drinking buddies that are going in on an empty stomach, Wurstkuche is a great place to grub good and chop it up with some peers and Debbie Downers alike!"

Ordering is actually pretty easy, you can look them up online and read about their menu or come in, fall in-line, get a menu pamphlet and decide what tickles your pickle. Sausage selection are plentiful, toppings come in an assortment of Caramelized sweet onions and sweet peppers, or your regular peppers or Sauerkraut. For me personally, I often look online first to kind of figure out what sounds really interesting ( wurstkuche.com/Eat.html ) so that by the time we're in-line to order the only thing that could possibly change my mind is if I see something that looks far better than what I had previously imagined and relished in my head... uhm..like those stacks of mouth-watering sausages in the display cabinet...haha On this visit I was planning on the fiery Louisiana Hot link but by the time I passed the display cabinet and was about to give my order I decided to get the Mango Jalapeno Sausage with a topping of Caramelized onions and sweet peppers. *grin* , I also ordered a side of Belgian fries (Large \"Groot\") with truffle oil glaze which also includes 2 dipping sauce.. I opted for the Chipotle Aioli & Sun dried Tomato Mayo..YUM!They have quite a few beer & beverage selection with the Unsweetened Darjeeling tea as one of the most popular, however, for today I just decided to get a bottle of San Pellegrino. My Mango Jalapeno sausage was delish,(chicken & turkey based), very flavorful and moist, the caramelized onion topping and sweet onions really gave this meal a delicious layer of flavor which made me wished I ordered 2 of these babies lol If I did not have the Belgian fries to finish, I might have went back in front and ordered another *grin*..yes, It's Deliciozo!My sister also had the Mango Jalapeno, My friends - the Sun Dried Tomato Mozzarella sausage which is also Chicken & Turkey based, and the Kielbasa - all received lovely comments from them with two thumbs up! The Belgian fries serving whether you order \"Klein or Groot\" (Sm or Lg) was pretty filling, those spuds like your typical Belgian fries are cut in hefty sizes...don't forget to dip 'em! those dipping sauce are fantastic!We truly enjoyed Wurstküche's offering, the sausages are amazing, the staff are fantastic (Thanks John!!), the place - very relaxed and good for groups! There is indoor and al fresco seating if watching zooming cars and people watching is your thing..okay okay--open air seating... hahaI definitely recommend trying out Wurstküche, the crowd is a mix of the young and old, professionals, students and your typical curious crowd. Keep an open mind and an open palate, be adventurous to try the gourmet sausages!..who knows! \"Vurst-koo-chee\" \"Worst-hoo-chie\" \"Burst-coo-shee\" might have the sausage that you've been dreaming of for a very very long time!Enjoy!"

Normally, she and I always eat Asian food (she is Chinese, after all), however, I wanted something different. She recommended Wurstküche and I am glad she did.I went in expecting the place to be like The Back Abbey in Claremont. In one sense, it is - they have Belgian and German draft beers on tap, and serve pomme-frites with dipping sauces. They are most notably known for their expansive selection of hot dogs - and boy do they have a great selection. This is no Dodger dog (eww), Weinerschnitzel, or even a Pink's dog, This is straight up amazingness for your tastebuds. Let's look at the menu, shall we? CLASSIC SAUSAGES------------------------------Bratwurstfine cuts of pork, coriander & nutmeg5.75Bockwurstveal, pork & spices5.75Hot Italianfine cuts of pork & spices5.75Vegetarian Italianfennel, garlic, red peppers & eggplant5.75Vegetarian Smoked Apple Sageapples, yukon potatoes & rubbed sage5.75Vegetarian Mexican Chipotlechipotle, arbol chilles, garlic, and onions5.75Gourmet Mustardsself serve, in back whole grain, dijon, GOURMET SAUSAGES--------------------------------Mango Jalapenochicken & turkey6.50Santa Fe Jack Cheese & Jalapeno Pepperssmoked turkey6.50Chicken Apple & Spiceschunks of apple & specks of cinnamon6.50Austin Blueshot and spicy, tri-pepper & hardwood smoked pork6.50Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarellasmoked chicken & turkey6.50Green Chillies & Cilantrochicken & turkey6.50Filipino Marharlikasweet pork, natural seasonings6.50Kielbasapolish style, pork & beef, onions and spices6.50Louisiana Hot Linkbeef & pork, onions and hot spices6.50EXOTIC SAUSAGES----------------------------Buffalo, Beef & Pork With Chipotle Pepperssmoky chipotle flavor7.50Duck & Bacon With Jalapeno Peppersjuicy and packed with flavor7.50Alligator & Pork, Smoked Andouille Sausagehickory smoked, thick casing7.50Rattlesnake & Rabbit With Jalapeno Peppersbuttery & mildly spicy7.50Rabbit, Veal & Pork Seasoned With White Winelight and delicate7.50Ok, so that's the menu. Now that you've seen it, why are you still reading my review? Why aren't you saying, \"Honey, call the babysitter, we're going to Wurstküche?!\" Because that's what you should be saying.The vibe is super chill. You order your food up front along with your beer, get a table # (they bring the food to you), and then you make your way down a long hallway, past the restrooms, and into a large dining room. There are several booths along the wall, and three large community tables in the middle of the dining room. Additionally, there is a large bar up against the wall. My friend and I sat in an alcove area, near the DJ. Oh yeah, they have a DJ. Additionally, they have a small outside dining area.For dinner, I had the Austin Blues and a Blanche de Bruxelles white Begian ale. Both were amazingly delicious. While I was tempted to order a second dog, I knew I would be full after eating so many pomme-frites. And yep, I was right - about 20 minutes later my friend and I went across the street to a farmer's market, and I felt the fullness.That said - the meal was totally worth it. Come hungry, and enjoy your fill of the goodness that is Wurstküche.If you're going to visit, scratch that, WHEN YOU VISIT, make sure you come early - they are known to have a line outside the door."

This place has changed so much over the years. It has become gentrified and quite a dense urban area. I like that it's changing with the revitalization of rest of downtown LA.  We arrived and found parking on the streets. There were random people walking on the streets and in wheelchairs so please be careful people, especially at night. We walked up and there were people sitting outside and we went in to order.The place to order was small but you eventually had to walk in and down a hallway to reach the seats and bar.  We ordered our food. I ordered the buffalo and pork sausage hotdog with large fries and a German beer. I was already a bit tipsy then and so when the cashier asked what toppings I wanted on there, I just spaced out and didn't know where the toppings were on the menu. My bad dude lol. I ordered, paid and went to go find a seat. Overall, I spent $23.72 for the sausage  hotdog,  large fries and German beer. A bit expensive but you get the convenience of having good food and beer. So I ordered, took my numbered placecard and walked down the hall to go find a seat. This was about 11pm, so there was plenty of seats. Was given a placecard with a number and we just waited for our food. The beer was delicious and in no time, the food arrived. I like that the restaurant had different sauces and condiments for fries. The sausage was Smokey and tasted similar to a pork and beef sausage. I liked that the hotdog bun was grilled to an extent and kept it warm. The buns were sweet and had a nice texture. I think if the sausages were a bit bigger, I'd taste more of the flavors of the sausage than just having majority of bread in my mouth. I had two toppings of grilled onions and sweet peppers. They were good but a bit cooled down once I bit into it. I liked dipping them into the curry ketchup and pesto mayo. The fries were like steak fries. They were okay, nothing out of the ordinary but went well with the condiments. I should have gotten the fries with the white truffle oil glaze for extra flavor. We had a good time just chatting and eating and left satisfied. I really enjoyed my food and the atmosphere. Would I back? Sure, whenever I'll be in the arts district again..."

        "review": "Even with the full-on Yelp effect, Wurstküche is still somewhat an enjoyable experience.I used to frequent establishments with legitimate claims to having the best brats/wursts in town (e.g. Rosamunde's in SF/NYC, Uli's up North, Frank in Austin) yet I can't really confess to having a distinguished palate when it comes to sausages. Sure, the exotic options like Buffalo, Rattlesnake, or Pheasant seem enticing, but if you were to blindfold me and put the three plus maybe a control sausage next to it and ask me to tell them apart, could I do it? Probably not. Do I think any of the other 6000+ yelp reviewers that have hyped up this establishment are capable of achieving the above feat? Maybe, but I remain on the skeptical side.Keeping the idea of \"exotic\" hot dogs on the back burner, my paradigm of a \"good hot dog\" can be illustrated with the following feedback loop:Is sausage hot? -- If yes, continue; if no, then bad hot dog. Is the bun toasted? -- If no, continue; if yes, then bad hot dog. Does sausage kind of \"crunch\" when you bite into it and release a variety of flavors ranging from spicy to sweet and maybe even salty --  If yes, continue; if no, then bad hot dog. Is the sausage purportedly made of an animal that would bring you immense satisfaction if you were locked in a cage fight and you had to beat it to death with your bare hands? -- If hell yes, continue; if omg wtf is wrong with you, then bad hot dog.Are there some veggies in the way of your sausage that will prevent you from scarfing your 8+ dollar gourmet sausage too fast? -- If yes, continue; if no then bad hot dog.Did the act of eating this hot dog make you grow a full-on beard, and another muscle-y arm under said beard -- If yes, good hot dog; if no, then normal hot dog.Diversions aside, there was somewhat of an outlandish wait for myself and my friend to get into this establishment. Lucky for us, our outlandish wait was somewhat mitigated by the fact that one of the awesome Wurstküche employees felt bad and started handing out samples of their featured sausage (I think it was the mango, which I'm deathly allergic to), and by the fact that there was a short obnoxiously drunk lesbian in line directly across from us making all kinds of a scene, with her seemingly cis and hetero friends trying their best at damage control. Once the novelty of the lesbian outburst wore off, another Wurstküche employee made his rounds and started taking beer orders. This helped, but not tremendously as I made it to beer #2 by the time I got to the order line. Point of the story being, the wait--like any other accredited place in this city--is miserable, but the establishment seems well aware of the fact and seems to go out of their way to accommodate and make it slightly less infuriating for all parties involved.Good food (almost all of their offerings passed my ridiculous flowchart), good beer (I would ideally like to see more IPAs/Sours to complement some of the more exotic and/or spicy sausages. The one Berliner Weisse that they had was okay, but not great), one screaming lesbian, and a very accommodating staff; this would be a five star joint for me if it were more of a biergarten and less of a wannabe-lounge/EDM club inside."

The fries are amazing. Had the perfect amount of salt and was fried to perfection.Love that there's ample seating and the space is open enough that even though the place was packed I didn't feel claustrophobic.To top it off, customer service was excellent. Even though the place was busy, I still felt welcomed and got served with a smile by every worker."

You line up to order and get your drink if you bought any, then you take your number and find seating in the back.  They bring you your food when it's ready.  Tons of beer and sausage selections.  They also have vegetarian sausages!Very tasty food with a nice, dimly - lit environment.  If you're up for dessert, there's a great pie store right across the street."

If you're here before dinner you're fine, but anything after 7.00p and on a Friday be prepared to wait. Overall, the würst (sausage) is really good. My favorites are the Kielbasa, the duck and Filipino sausage. The fries are a must. They are fried to perfection since I love crispy fries. Now the beer. Omg if you love beer come here. They serve you your beer in the appropriate cups. A majority of their beers are german so don't look for American beers. Best of all, they have a Kranz. So you can order a Kranz and treat your friends to a friendly prost. Seating is also communal which makes it even cooler."

Portions are small, prices are high.FOOD:~ FYI, You can choose two toppings on any of the sausages. I chose caramelized onions and sweet peppers on top. At the tables, they have a variety of mustards like whole grain, dijon, spicy brown, honey mustard, american yellow, and ketchup.~~ Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeño Peppers, $8 ~~ Tasted like a normal spicy hot dog or sausage. Nothing special except the fact that it's from snake and rabbit.~~ Lamb with Mediterranean Spices, $8 ~~ Lamb was pretty good, but wasn't worth the price!~~ Large Belgian fries, $5.50 ~~ Comes with two dipping sauces. The chipotle aioli was pretty good. Skip the chipotle ketchup, it was weird. I would have picked something else if I knew there would be ketchup at the tables. Fries are put through the fryer twice, which makes them nice and crisp on the outside and still soft on the inside. However, portion for this was tiny! I would be scared to see how many fries come in a small.ALKY:Tip: Check the portion sizes because different drinks come in different sizes. So you might think you're buying a cheaper beer but in reality it's tiny!~~ Aspall English Cider, $11 ~~ I'm a cider gal, so I ordered the only cider on the menu. It didn't taste like a cider and I forced myself to finish it cuz it cost $11!~~ Früli, $8 ~~ Tried a sample of it (they do give you small samples if you ask) and it was pretty good! Very fruity beer, but it's $8 for 330mL.LOCATION:Hard to find parking (you're in downtown LA so what can you expect though). Metered parking around and if you get lucky you'll find some free street parking.SERVICE: There was a waitress taking orders of beer when you got closer to the front but she was impatient and gave off a vibe that she didn't want to be here working. She was really picky about where we stood and that we had to be close to the wall and move forward immediately as soon as there was space, even if it got in the way of those walking through to the tables. ATMOSPHERE: The line was out the door and moved super slow. There's only one cashier so that may be why, but when we got to the cashier we already knew our order since we'd been waiting so long, so I don't know why it still takes that long. After you order, you move to the back of the place to find parking. It's dark and loud inside, so not great if you want to have an actual conversation without yelling. OVERALL: Wouldn't come back. Wouldn't even suggest you to try it once, unless you're dying to experience a place with so many Yelp reviews."

The exterior design of bricks looks amazing and the interior has a fancy nice modern feel. And the food is amazing!  The bratwursts are cooked perfectly and I come here all the time.  The only thing is the service is a touch slow but the amazing food definitely makes up for it. They also have a amazing selection of imported beers, and an amazing vegetarian selection for not meat eaters (for a bratwurst restaurant that is impressive). This is the best bratwurst restauraunt I have ever been to and their exotic sausages bring a whole new meaning to the word bratwurst. I come here all the time and I definitely recommend it."

I thought they might be good, since the sausages sounded so interesting. It was surprisingly & pleasantly good. I mean blew me away, I didn't expect it to taste this good kind of good. Wow, sausage king here.-Rattlesnake & Rabbit (5*) w/Jalapeno. Never had rattlesnake sausage before. Had rattlesnake before, yes, but not in this way & definitely not this good. Damn this is some good sausage. The sausage casing has a crunch/bite to it, which all good sausage should. It was grilled perfectly with a seared exterior, awesome. The sausage itself is a meaty-sweet, juicy, charred, smoky deliciousness with a tiny kick. My favorite sausage there so far. So much flavor in a small package. The bun is housemade & fresh. It's light, airy texture with a slightly toasted exterior. I like this bun a lot. We got sauerkraut & sweet peppers with this one which gives it a refreshing sweet twist. They have ketchup or two different kinds of mustard at the table. Didn't need it, it's that good.-Duck & Bacon (5*) w/Jalapeno. Such a good sausage. Strong hints of bacon, you can also sense the duck. It's also juicy with smoky, meaty-sweet, bacon-saltiness flavors. All meld in good ways. The bacon flavor is not overpowering at all. It's just right where it lets other flavors stand out as well. My wife's favorite out of the two. I love both, but my vote is for the rattlesnake above. This was topped with caramelized onions & sauerkraut. The sweetness of the sauerkraut & caramelized onions go very well with the saltiness of the bacon flavor. Not much of a kick even though there are jalapenos in the sausage, but very delicious nevertheless.-Belgian Fries (5*) w/Truffle Oil. You can tell these were double dipped fried (just like it says on the menu). Dark brown in color, crispy outside & mushy soft inside. Hints of truffle. Delicious. Got the Chipotle Aioli, very good dipping sauce. We can eat these all day but if you're on the health kick, then perhaps ease up. Or don't try them at all because once you eat one, you won't be able to stop yourself afterwards. Be forewarned, these are addictingly not good for you. At least we'll die happy. =)-Sweet Blossom (5*) soda. It was recommended by a very knowledgeable employee that was there to answer questions regarding their sausages, food & drinks. As she said, it is a refreshing drink. Sweet but not too sweet. It's carbonated, just like how the wifey likes it. Can't describe the flavor but it's got hints of honey maybe. It's just good. Try it."

I am a returning customer and would recommend this place to others. I like coming here for lunch as it is not so busy and they have nice outdoor seating. In the evenings it may be a bit to dark and loud inside but it is just a style of that place so nothing to complain about."

Here's why:The service:All of the wait staff were attentive, kind, helpful, and happy. It's as if they actually enjoy being there, and they are glad that you are there. They offered suggestions, assisted with the ordering process, and were über kind to my children. Throughout the meal, servers dropped by the table to check on us. The ambiance:This is a beautifully designed urban space. It's inviting, and beckons you to stay. It's lit almost entirely by natural sunlight. The food:My family ordered the Rattlesnake and Rabbit, the Lamb, the Duck and Bacon and the Chicken and Apple sausages, along with a couple of orders of Belgian fries. My family loved everything (we divvied). The sausages are delicious, flavorful, and satisfying. A lot of love goes into making 'em. The fries are life-changing. They're double-fried, so they have the right amount of crisp (in my subjective opinion). You get a choice of dipping sauces. Love the Thai Peanut sauce. Excellent experience. We shall return.

I just had yet to cross snake off my list of animals that aren't safe from my plate.We shared the fries, which were good, that came with two sauces. She picked pesto, I picked the blue cheese. I was unimpressed by the blue cheese sauce. I think it should have been stronger. Would I go back? Sure, if the line wasn't long like it was when we were leaving. We only waited about 5-10 minutes.

The Kielbasa is pretty good, too.My preferred topping set are caramelized onions and sweet peppers. I greatly appreciate the variety of available mustards - my favorites are Dijon and honey mustard. Sweet & Sassy BBQ sauce is a solid choice to go with the fries.The staff is generally pretty cool to deal with, although during my first visit, the cashier was somewhat of a dick.This place can be insanely packed with customers even on a weeknight.

However, Tonight was a special occasion because a special Hawaiian honored us with his presence. We cut loose and spent the big bucks on the EXOTICS plus one Gourmet Filipino! We couldn't decide on what toppings to put, so we just told them to surprise us. Easiest ordering ever. Usually, when I think of sausages, I think of a variety of meats that mix together. I am often skeptical of whether the meat i ordered was actually in the sausage. It seems to easy to mask the true tastes. This time around we taste tested 6 sausages amongst 3 guys to prove which one was tastiest and which one ripped us off. MY RESULTS: BEST TO WORST Pheasant with Herbs de Provence - Dense, chicken like. Clean. I think we have a winner, winner, pheasant dinner!Rabbit + Pork with Leeks and Carrots - Light, flavorful. I liked it. I tried the rabbit leg at 'Animal' and thought I could taste the rabbit in this as well. Did not make me feel ripped off. Lucky rabbit foot I tell you. Filipino Maharlika - Nice, sweet, and smooth. Renamed the 'Filipino My heart like aah!'Duck and Bacon with Jalapeno Peppers - I think the bacon over powers the duck. I searched for the duck flavor but I couldn't really find it. Off to Chinatown I go.Buffalo, Beef and Pork w Chipotle Peppers - Good but had a few chunks of fat in it. Had to spit it out. Spitting out chunks of fat isn't very exotic or sexy. RattleSnake + Rabbit + Jalapeno Peppers - Smelled kinda funny. This was the only sausage I voluntarily put mustard on to mask the flavor... Totally rattled my insides.There you have it, 3 Guys... 6 sausages"
