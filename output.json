        "review": "My new fave DTLA dinner spot!!I'm not a fan of German foods as they are usually pretty fatty and not that tasty (talking mostly about pubs here), but little did I know this restaurant is unlike all the rest!They specialize in different types of sausages! They even have categories from traditional flavors to exotic ones.There was a long line when we arrived and this was on a Wednesday night so be prepared for that. I'm not sure where everyone else parked but we found street parking about 10 minutes away. Still beats the $12 price tag for the parking lot nearby.This restaurant is mostly counter service. You order your sausages and some beers in the front and then when you go to the back you take a seat at either a small table or one of the long tables with benches! That's a neat touch. There is also a bar in the back where you can oder more drinks and fries.I ordered the chicken apple sausage and my husband ordered the rattlesnake! Both were delicious but I was more of a fan of the chicken apple because I always prefer things a little sweeter. We shared the pheasant sausage, which was okay. A little too spicy for me. You have a choice of toppings and I went with the caramelized onions and the sweet bell pepper, so good! When you order for a big group they give you a big platter of all the toppings so I tried a little of all the toppings but I was still happy with my 2 choices.Seriously can't wait to come back!!!"

        "review": "I've had this place bookmarked for ages but never managed to try it out until last year. I came here with my friend CW on a weekday evening and thankfully the line wasn't too long. Like most of the businesses in this area, Wurstkuche does not have their own parking so you have to find street parking in the area. We found a spot a couple blocks away and walked on over. You stand in line to order at the counter and then you find seating in the back area (they also have a patio as well). They have a large space in the back with plenty of spacing, thank goodness. The best part of this visit was that I found out how to pronounce the name! It's wurst-ku-keh!This place is known for their sausages, which come served on a freshly baked roll with your choice of two toppings (out of four). They have a large sausage menu - 6 classic choices, 7 gourmet choices, and 8 exotic choices. I decided to go with the \"gourmet\" choice of Sun Dried Tomato & Mozzarella, with chicken and turkey meat. I got it with Caramelized Onions and Sauerkraut. You can help yourself to as much ketchup and mustard (five kinds) as you want in the back as they are self-serve. The sausage was decent but the sauerkraut was meh and overall I was not as impressed with the sausage as I had hoped I would be.They also offer Belgian Fries, which are double dipped and served with your choice of sauces. You can get the Klein, which is their small and comes with one dipping sauce, or the Groot, which is large and comes with two dipping sauces. They have 10 dipping sauces total and if you want additional ones it will be $0.75 each. I do not remember which dipping sauces we got but we got the Groot because (1) I love that name bc of Guardians of the Galaxy and (2) we were sharing so of course we needed the larger size. I love fries so of course these were great! Can't go wrong with getting the fries here.The ambience, setting, service, and fries here were all great. Even the bathroom is pretty nice! But I was not impressed with my sausage, so I probably won't come back... unless I'm in the area and craving their fries ;)"

The sauces (6) they provide on the side were delicious, so I added some of that every bite or so. The fries were also delicious. Would recommend getting both :) Ambience was great as well. Good music (DJ was there), Dim lighting, and paper covered tables with crayons to draw on them. Oh, and fast service!"

        "review": "If you are a big fan of sausages, this is the place for you. Man that sounds bad but it's true.  They have a wide variety of meats that will make any hungry patron go completely crazy. For example, myself. I am visiting from out of town and I had literally just gotten out from LAX. I tell my companions that we need to eat here. And so we do. Like any place that serves sausages, they have their  basics. Bratwurst (my fav), hot link, etc. what I do love the most is that they create sausages using different meats. Now call me naive, but I've never had different types of meat in sausage form. They had duck which is a delight and rabbit which I have yet to try. Ladies and gentlemen, this place is a must if you're in LA. BEER, food and a great interior atmosphere. It can get a bit loud in there but who's really paying attention? Enjoy and eat up!!"

They offer a lot of unique hot dog meat and my favorite is the bacon & duck hot dog. Amazing! Don't forget to order the truffle fries with garlic aioli sauce as well. Bomb!I love visiting this place since it's opened until pretty late and great place to catch up with friends. The beer selection here is awesome and the staff is also really friendly. You can't go wrong starting your night here!"

Personally, I've had better sausages, but definitely come here to try the rattlesnake and rabbit sausage just to say you've eaten those animals. (just realized vegetarians probably hate me now for writing that...) The sausages were a little bland, but maybe it's the meat? Or it could be seasoned more? Also, what's fun about this place is they provide crayons where you can doodle on the butcher-paper placemats!"

        "review": "Not your typic hot dog joint .. I remember when this place opened all my Central Division friends were blowing this place up. Great dogs , good beer selection ( for of duty drinking of course) and great fries ! I always remember a line when I come here , and during the day you probably don't have to wait for a table.So this particular Saturday night , I was meeting up with some friends in the Arts district. I've been training  a lot lately for desert racing and decided I'd stop in for a bite and beers before the venue. It was spot on with hipsters , a line and standing room only.I decided to vegetarian dog with carmelized onions and sweet peppers - with a side of fries. I grabbed my number and steered toward the music. Standing room only and a Dj bumpin the groove I headed toward the bar . I was lucky enough to get the only open seat ! I ordered a brew and begin to unwind. It was a bit noisy with the music , and people trying to talk but calm - compared to my 450 screaming in the desert.My food came about 15 minutes later , when I was conversing with a couple of youngster first timers . The fries caught their attention , and I had gotten the peanut dip sauce ( a first time for me). I relaxed with another beer as I watched the fries disappear .As I departed I made a note on the next visit  I'm gonna try an exotic and get a large order of fries . One thing I remember seeing is they offered beer flights , a definite must try. So all in all 4 stars .Just a note to Nikki , one of the youngsters who was stealing my fries. You had the pretties blue eyes I've seen in a long time , see you on Yelp ."

Thankfully we arrived just in time to miss the long line and grab a seat at the bar.I ordered a Bitburger which was great. I also ordered a link which I can't recall the name with grilled onions and  sauerkraut. Good...but not amazing. As we walked to other breweries we noticed the line here was out the door.Someone...please, guide me lol. What's THE item here to make me love this place?!"

I've been eating here since it first opened, but it's still a place I'll go every so often. I love the range of different sausages they have, the different sauces, the beers, and best of all, the fries.Everything goes so well together. The sausages have such a nice bite to them, both in spiciness and in texture from the casing. Get the caramelized onions and spicy peppers on top of your sausages. Get the truffle oil on your fries.Try every sauce they have. Try the bleu cheese with walnut & bacon. And the Chipotle aoili. If you're feeling adventurous, try the ketchup. Enjoy.THen walk over to the 82 arcade for some games. Over walk over to Pie hole for a dessert."

It was pretty busy but we were able to find a table pretty quickly. They have pretty good beer. I was pretty excited to try the different types of hot dogs. Between 2 of us we had 3 hot dogs. Here's a break down of the food: Rattlesnake dog: 4 STARS honestly, it doesn't taste much different than other ones. it had some sort of spicy level Veggie: 5 STARS really glad I got thisChicken Mango: 5 STARS Delicious, I was so stuffed by the time we ate this onethe most delicious part of our meal was probably all the sauces they offer BUT they are not free."

        "review": "Hefeweizens + grilled sausage and fries + DJ = awesome spot!----------------------We've been to this place a few times. This is at a very unique corner between little Tokyo and downtown / skid row. This has definitely become a hipster part of town, with apartments, umami burger, eighty two barcade, etc. The food here is pretty awesome. The Filipino maharlica (spelling) is good, reminds me of Chinese sweet sausage. Thick cut steak fries are crisped just right. Their mustard selections at table side are pretty bomb. Plus, they have butcher paper on the tables, so feel free to doodle while you wait. The best part? Their beer selection. I'm a huge Hef fan (beer and person), and they serve insane liter beers (like in German Biergartens). Good times were had by all. So come early, come often. Just be ready for the lines. And parking may be an issue, gotta pay for valet more often than not (unless you're willing to find street parking a few blocks away in the sketchier parts)"

I think they're in the top 5 places in the world with the most Yelp reviews, and rightfully so! They're running the operations like a top & the food is on point. Be prepared to wait a bit, but it's worth it!When you walk in, a staffmember hands you a menu as you wait in line to order your food. He was taking drink orders for people that wanted a beer while waiting in line to order at the counter. Sara & I shared the original bratwurst with sweet peppers & onions, and a large fries with chipotle aioli & pesto mayo. Yum! For $16, it wasn't bad to share... would have been a lot of food for one person but good to share with another. They have several beers on tap + wines (no liquor).For a damn good German bratwurst, be sure to check out Wurstkuche when you're in DTLA... unless the line is killer long, you won't be disappointed :)"

        "review": "Usually sausages would not be my go to entre; however on the recommendation of a friend, I brought my partner-in-dine here last weekend for a date night. Do not be afraid of the line, the friendliest, most accommodating host guides you quickly through the line, the menu, and even brings you a beer of your choice to enjoy while you wait to order from their extensive case of in house made sausages. The beer menu is an array of elusive craft beers, which you can sample away to find the right fit for your palette and your meal. The sausages vary from the milder choices such as Kielbasa to intricate pairings such as duck, bacon, and jalapeno. You may choose two toppings, and it is served on a home made bun. SOOOOOO GOOOD!Our choices:-Keilbasa with caramelized onions and spicy peppers-Duck, bacon and jalapeno with sauerkrat-Double dipped fries are a MUST! You may choose two sauces. We ordered Curry Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli.Beyond the exceptional food, the atmosphere also won me over. You seat yourself either at a small table or you can mingle with others at long picnic tables. However we chose the bar (it was all that was open!), which was great for easy access to sampling more beers. Three cheers for Wurstkuche!P.s. They have a bathroom. Parking is terrible."

They have condiments all throughout their dining area (Ketchup, Mustard, Honey Mustard, etc.). You can order 2 toppings to go with your sausages - caramelized onions, sweet peppers, sauerkraut, and spicy peppers.Their beer menu is pretty good! I loved their Floris Apple Ale - it was REALLY sweet and refreshing. My friend ordered 2 Chimays, which I think he thoroughly enjoyed. **Tip: They also have a bar in the back dining area.My friend and I shared the Rattlesnake & Rabbit with Jalapeno Peppers & White Truffle Oil Glaze Fries w/ Chipotle Aioli & Ranch. I also ordered the Kielbasa, and my friend had the Louisiana Hot Link. This was A LOT of food. I loved everything!! It's a trendy spot that looks tiny from the entrance, but they have decent amount of community style seating in their dining area."

But I decided to stop by Wurstkuche because they have such an interesting exotic variety of sausages and meats. The parking sucks. Unless you can find street parking, be expected to pay around $7-$10 at marked lots. Came in around lunch time, there was a bit of a line but nothing too bad. You order your food at the register and they hand you a number and you go inside the restaurant where there are a plethora of tables to sit at. One thing I really also appreciated about Wurstkuche was they have 5 different mustards for you to use on your hotdog! Talk about variety! I had the Rattlesnake and Rabbit Hot dog and it was so delicious! Defiantly not your ordinary basic hotdog. It was so flavorful, I kept eating it fast and regretting it because it was still pretty hot but I couldn't help to just chow it down. If you're in arts district I strongly suggest this place! Also they have an incredible selection of beers! A great place to kick it with your date or friends."

Hoping to try them all at one point or another.+ To date, I've had the Louisiana Hot Link, Kielbasa and Hot Italian. All equally delicious and flavorful. Get the sweet onion and peppers and pair with fries. Don't forget the chipotle aioli or pesto mayo. Pair with whatever bier is recommended.+ Staff has always been accommodating, friendly and prompt. They got you every time.+ Get in line, grab a drink, place your order and take a seat inside or outside. Inside is loud, lively and communal, while outside is more local and chill. Both are great options to enjoy depending on your mood.+ There is a bar inside if you just want one of their many artisanal biers on draft.+ DJ on site some days, spinning good things.+ Dessert at Pie Hole, anyone? Major bonus points.Cons:- Parking is hideous. If all else fails and you get tired or run out of gas from making the rounds, settle for one of the lots at your discretion. Use them as an absolute last resort.- There is almost always a line for dinner on weekends, maybe even weekdays. There will be a wait of 25+ minutes."

Its nestled in the cute arts district, so perfect place to grab lunch, drinks, dinner, and then you can grab coffee (Groundwork) or dessert (Pie Hole) literally walking distance! The place can get a bit busy and loud at nights and weekends, but its all a part of the experience! Highlights: - Rattlesnake: For those that have never been here, I know this may sound a bit \"out there\", but its really not. Think about what you are eating when you are eating a sausage...just ground up meat, which is exactly what they do when they incorporate the rattlesnake and its delicious! It doesn't taste that different from a typical sausage you would try elsewhere, just slightly more flavorful, so I would definitely recommend this hot dog! If you are contemplating between the alligator and the rattlesnake, I highly recommend the rattlesnake!- Vegetarian Mexican Chipotle: Yum! I was recommended this sausage for vegetarians that like spicy! Its not that spicy, but very flavorful and simply delicious! - French Fries: MUST GET THE FRIES and the dipping sauces! The French fries here are just delicious and their dipping sauces pair perfectly with everything. My personal favorite sauces are: Pesto Mayo / Sundried Tomato Aioli / Chipotle Aioli*Only downfall to this place is the parking, but I have always managed to find parking with some patience!"
